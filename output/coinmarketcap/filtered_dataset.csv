1,Bitcoin,bitcoin,BTC,active,coin,"## **What Is Bitcoin (BTC)?**\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper) by a person, or group of people, using the alias [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto). It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take) happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.\n\n\n### **Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2020, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “[blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain).”\n\nJust two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the [genesis block](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block), thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.\n\nBitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.\n\n\n#### **What Makes Bitcoin Unique?**\n\nBitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.\n\nIt has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.\n\n[The entire cryptocurrency market](https://coinmarketcap.com/) — now worth more than $300 billion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.\n\nThanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), with a market capitalization that fluctuated between $100-$200 billion in 2020, owing in large part to the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet), exchanges, payment services, online games and more.\n\n\n##### **Related Pages:**\n\nLooking for market and blockchain data for BTC?

Use CoinMarketCap’s [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n\n[Should you buy Bitcoin with PayPal?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/if-you-buy-bitcoin-on-paypal-you-didnt-buy-bitcoin-crypto-expert-claims)\n\n[What is wrapped Bitcoin?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin)\n\n[Will Bitcoin volatility ever reduce?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/will-bitcoin-volatility-ever-reduce)\n\n#### **How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?**\n\nBitcoin’s total supply is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as [“mining”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin): as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.\n\nAs compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets [halved](https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/) with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\n\n[Mining Bitcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin) can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss [how long it takes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) to mine one Bitcoin on CMC Alexandria — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin.\n\n#### **How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?**\n\nBitcoin is secured with the [SHA-256 algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256), which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash ([BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.\n\n### How Much Is Bitcoin?\n\nThe current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much is Bitcoin will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much is Bitcoin will be a function of a person’s location. \n\n#### **Where Can You Buy Bitcoin (BTC)?**\n\nBitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can [buy Bitcoin](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Bitcoin) on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main markets where BTC trading is available are:\n\n\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)\n*   [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)\n*   [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/)\n*   [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)\n*   [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/)\n\nIf you are new to crypto, use CoinMarketCap’s own [easy guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to buying Bitcoin.",bitcoin,,"mineable, pow, sha-256, store-of-value, state-channels, coinbase-ventures-portfolio, three-arrows-capital-portfolio, polychain-capital-portfolio, binance-labs-portfolio, arrington-xrp-capital, blockchain-capital-portfolio, boostvc-portfolio, cms-holdings-portfolio, dcg-portfolio, dragonfly-capital-portfolio, electric-capital-portfolio, fabric-ventures-portfolio, framework-ventures, galaxy-digital-portfolio, huobi-capital, alameda-research-portfolio, a16z-portfolio, 1confirmation-portfolio, winklevoss-capital, usv-portfolio, placeholder-ventures-portfolio, pantera-capital-portfolio, multicoin-capital-portfolio, paradigm-xzy-screener","Mineable, PoW, SHA-256, Store of Value, State channels, Coinbase Ventures Portfolio, Three Arrows Capital Portfolio, Polychain Capital Portfolio, Binance Labs Portfolio, Arrington XRP capital, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, BoostVC Portfolio, CMS Holdings Portfolio, DCG Portfolio, DragonFly Capital Portfolio, Electric Capital Portfolio, Fabric Ventures Portfolio, Framework Ventures, Galaxy Digital Portfolio, Huobi Capital, Alameda Research Portfolio, A16Z Portfolio, 1Confirmation Portfolio, Winklevoss Capital, USV Portfolio, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio, Pantera Capital Portfolio, Multicoin Capital Portfolio, Paradigm XZY Screener",https://bitcoin.org/,,https://bitcointalk.org,,"https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/chain/bitcoin, https://blockchain.info/, https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/, https://blockchair.com/bitcoin, https://explorer.viabtc.com/btc",https://reddit.com/r/bitcoin,https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf,https://github.com/bitcoin/,,,2013-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,,True
2,Litecoin,litecoin,LTC,active,coin,"## What Is Litecoin (LTC)?\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology. \n\nThe cryptocurrency was created based on the [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments. \n\nLitecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a ""lite version of Bitcoin,"" in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Litecoin?\n\nAs we previously touched on, Litecoin was founded by Charlie Lee, an early cryptocurrency adopter and a name held in high regard in the cryptocurrency industry. \n\nCharlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures.\n\n \\\nToday, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin. \n\nBesides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors: Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right. \n\n\n#### What Makes Litecoin Unique?\n\nBehind Bitcoin, Litecoin is the second most popular pure cryptocurrency. This success can be largely attributed to its simplicity and clear utility benefits. \n\nAs of January 2021, Litecoin is one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, and more than 2,000 merchants and stores now accept LTC across the globe. \n\nIts main benefit comes from its speed and cost-effectiveness. Litecoin transactions are typically confirmed in just minutes, and transaction fees are nearly negligible. This makes it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin in developing countries, where transaction fees may be the deciding factor on which cryptocurrency to support. \n\nIn late 2020, Litecoin also saw the release of the [MimbleWimble](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mimblewimble) (MW) testnet, which is used to test Mimblewimble-based confidential transactions on Litecoin. Once this feature is available on the mainnet, Litecoin users will also benefit from greatly enhanced privacy and fungibility. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) — the original cryptocurrency.\n\nCheck out [Nano (NANO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nano/) — another lightweight, fast cryptocurrency.\n\nGet up to date with the latest Litecoin [updates and discussion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/social/).\n\nSubscribe to the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog) for the latest cryptocurrency news and updates.\n\n\n#### How Many Litecoin (LTC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike most proof-of-work ([POW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) cryptocurrencies, the amount of Litecoin in circulation gradually increases with each newly mined block. \n\nAs of January 2021, 66.245 million LTC have already been mined out of a total maximum supply of 84 million. The Litecoin Foundation recently estimated it will be well over 100 years until Litecoin reaches full dilution (around the year 2140) — since the number of LTC mined per block decreases every four years as part of the block reward halving schedule.\n\nAround 500,000 LTC was instamined on day one after the LTC genesis block was mined and Charlie Lee and presumably other early Litecoin developers were among the first miners. \n\nDespite this, as a fairly distributed asset, the Litecoin developers or Charlie Lee do not receive any direct profits from the operation of Litecoin—other than anything they may earn as part of the regular mining process. \n\n\n### How Is the Litecoin Network Secured?\n\nAs a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Litecoin is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack. \n\nLike Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the PoW [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm to ensure transactions are confirmed quickly and without errors. The combined strength of the Litecoin mining network prevents double-spends and a range of other attacks, while ensuring the network has 100% uptime. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Litecoin (LTC)?\n\nLitecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more when you [buy Litecoin](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Litecoin). Some of the most prominent names include [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/). \n\nLitecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more.

52,XRP,xrp,XRP,active,coin,"###What Is XRP?\r\nTo begin with, it’s important to understand the difference between XRP, Ripple and RippleNet. XRP is the currency that runs on a digital payment platform called RippleNet, which is on top of a distributed ledger database called XRP Ledger. While RippleNet is run by a company called Ripple, the XRP Ledger is open-source and is not based on blockchain, but rather the previously mentioned distributed ledger database.\r\n\r\nThe RippleNet payment platform is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that aims to enable instant monetary transactions globally. While XRP is the cryptocurrency native to the XRP Ledger, you can actually use any currency to transact on the platform.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea behind the Ripple payment platform was first voiced in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, it wasn’t until Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project in 2012 that Ripple began to be built (at the time, it was also called OpenCoin). \r\n\r\n\r\n###How Does XRP Work?\r\n\r\nXRP was created by Ripple to be a speedy, less costly and more scalable alternative to both other digital assets and existing monetary payment platforms like SWIFT. \r\n\r\nRippleNet’s ledger is maintained by the global XRP Community, with Ripple the company as an active member. The XRP Ledger processes transactions roughly every 3-5 seconds, or whenever independent validator nodes come to a consensus on both the order and validity of XRP transactions — as opposed to proof-of-work mining like Bitcoin (BTC). Anyone can be a Ripple validator, and the list is currently made up of Ripple along with universities, financial institutions and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n###How Do You Buy XRP?\r\n\r\nYou can buy XRP on any exchange that offers the digital currency.

74,Dogecoin,dogecoin,DOGE,active,coin,"### What Is Dogecoin?\nDogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular ""doge"" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was [created by](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/dogecoin-a-stunning-surge-a-crushing-blow-a-surprise-comeback) Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.\n \n### How Do You Mine Dogecoin?\nDogecoin differs from Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined.\nYou can mine Dogecoin either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged.\n \n### What Can Dogecoin Be Used For?\nDogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities.\n \n### How Can You Buy Dogecoin?\nYou can buy or sell Dogecoin at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.

1027,Ethereum,ethereum,ETH,active,coin,"## What Is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), as well as for the execution of decentralized [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nEthereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014 and officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015.\n\nEthereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.\n\n* Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.\n\n* British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.\n\nAmong the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - [Charles Hoskinson](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/), who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.\n\n\n#### What Makes Ethereum Unique?\n\nEthereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.\n\nEthereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.\n\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) and [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/).\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nNew to crypto?

Read our [blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)!\n\n\n#### How Many Ethereum (ETH) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nIn August 2020, there were around 112 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.\n\nThe remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.\n\nOne of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s economics is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers [justify](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/) this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.\n\n\n#### How Is the Ethereum Network Secured?\nAs of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions.\n\nThere are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) update, which launched in late 2020.\n\nAfter the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (acting as a validator) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, basically acting as a miner and thus securing the network. At the time of writing in mid-December 2020, the Ethereum stake price, or the amount of money earned daily by Ethereum validators, is about 0.00403 ETH a day, or $2.36. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase.\n\nEthereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards are at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually.\n\nThe minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed.\n\n#### Where Can You Buy Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nGiven the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to [buy Ethereum](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Ethereum), or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges. Some of the largest markets include:\n\n* [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n* [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)\n* [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)\n* [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/)\n* [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)",ethereum,,"mineable, pow, smart-contracts, ethereum, coinbase-ventures-portfolio, three-arrows-capital-portfolio, polychain-capital-portfolio, binance-labs-portfolio, arrington-xrp-capital, blockchain-capital-portfolio, boostvc-portfolio, cms-holdings-portfolio, dcg-portfolio, dragonfly-capital-portfolio, electric-capital-portfolio, fabric-ventures-portfolio, framework-ventures, hashkey-capital-portfolio, kinetic-capital, huobi-capital, alameda-research-portfolio, a16z-portfolio, 1confirmation-portfolio, winklevoss-capital, usv-portfolio, placeholder-ventures-portfolio, pantera-capital-portfolio, multicoin-capital-portfolio, paradigm-xzy-screener","Mineable, PoW, Smart Contracts, Ethereum, Coinbase Ventures Portfolio, Three Arrows Capital Portfolio, Polychain Capital Portfolio, Binance Labs Portfolio, Arrington XRP capital, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, BoostVC Portfolio, CMS Holdings Portfolio, DCG Portfolio, DragonFly Capital Portfolio, Electric Capital Portfolio, Fabric Ventures Portfolio, Framework Ventures, Hashkey Capital Portfolio, Kinetic Capital, Huobi Capital, Alameda Research Portfolio, A16Z Portfolio, 1Confirmation Portfolio, Winklevoss Capital, USV Portfolio, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio, Pantera Capital Portfolio, Multicoin Capital Portfolio, Paradigm XZY Screener",https://www.ethereum.org/,https://twitter.com/ethereum,https://forum.ethereum.org/,https://gitter.im/orgs/ethereum/rooms,"https://etherscan.io/, https://ethplorer.io/, https://blockchair.com/ethereum, https://bscscan.com/token/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8, https://eth.tokenview.com/en/blocklist",https://reddit.com/r/ethereum,https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper,https://github.com/ethereum,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0,,2015-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,,True

1437,Zcash,zcash,ZEC,active,coin,"## What Is Zcash (ZEC)?\n\nZcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on privacy and anonymity. It uses the zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proof technology that allows nodes on the network to verify transactions without revealing any sensitive information about those transactions.\n\nContrary to a common misunderstanding, the majority of cryptocurrencies on the market, including Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)), are not anonymous, but rather [pseudonymous](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/is-cryptocurrency-anonymous); while they do not explicitly reveal the identities of their users, each user has their own public address or addresses which can be traced back to them via the methods of data science and [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) forensics.\n\nZcash transactions, on the other hand, still have to be relayed via a public blockchain, but unlike pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, ZEC transactions by default do not reveal the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being sent. There is an option, however, to reveal this data for the purposes of auditing or regulatory compliance.\n\nZcash was first released on October 28, 2016, and it was originally based on Bitcoin’s codebase.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Zcash?\n\nZcash was founded in 2016 by cypherpunk, computer security expert and entrepreneur Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. He is also the founder of the for-profit Electronic Coin Company (ECC), which manages the development of Zcash.\n\nWilcox-O’Hearn has spent more than 25 years in the industry of cryptography and information security and has contributed to a number of projects, including the now-defunct electronic money firm DigiCash, peer-to-peer data storing software Mojo Nation and the Tahoe Least-Authority File Store filesystem.\n\nHe also founded Least Authority Enterprises, a technology company focused on improving digital security and preserving the fundamental right to privacy, and co-invented the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function.\n\n\n#### What Makes Zcash Unique?\n\nZcash’s main advantage lies in its optional anonymity, which allows for a level of privacy unattainable with regular, pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nZEC transactions can be sent in two ways: transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions work in about the same way as in [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take), whose codebase Zcash was originally based on: they are sent between public addresses and are recorded on an immutable public ledger (the blockchain). All essential information about these transactions is available online for anyone to see, including the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent.\n\nThese public transactions do not reveal user identities in an overt manner: the only identifiers an outside observer can access from the blockchain are public addresses. However, through the efforts of data scientists and law enforcement over recent years, the methods of blockchain analysis have been developed to the point where an interested party can fairly reliably connect a public address on a blockchain to the real-world identity of its owner, essentially making private transactions impossible.\n\nShielded ZEC transactions, on the other hand, leverage the technology of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, or [zk-SNARKs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks), in order to enable completely anonymous transactions to be sent over a public immutable blockchain. The fact that the transaction _has _happened is recorded on the ledger, but the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent is not revealed to the public.\n\nThis allows Zcash to offer its users the right to privacy while still enjoying the advantages of a decentralized, permissionless digital currency.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/), another anonymous cryptocurrency that uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to improve user privacy.\n\nCheck out more crypto educational information on CMC [Alexandria](Alexandria).\n\nFind topical crypto stories on CMC’s [blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Zcash (ZEC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOverall, Zcash tokenomics is similar to that of Bitcoin: it is a scarce [mineable](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-mined-coins) token with a total supply limit of 21 million coins.\n\nNew ZECs are created in the form of “block subsidies”: whenever [a new block is mined](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mining-zcash-explained) and added to the end of the blockchain, a certain amount of coins is minted and split into “miner subsidy” and “founders’ reward” at a ratio of 80 to 20 percent respectively. The block subsidy is halved at regular intervals to slow down the issuance rate as the total supply of ZEC approaches its limit of 21 million.\n\nThe miner subsidy goes to the miner who has mined the latest block and the founders’ reward is distributed between Electronic Coin Company (ECC) founders, Zcash Foundation and ECC itself, as well as its employees. As of October 2020, the block subsidy is equal to 6.25 ZEC.\n\n\n### How Is the Zcash Network Secured?\n\nZcash network is secured by the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [SHA-256](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256) hash function which belongs to the SHA-2 set of algorithms — same as Bitcoin.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Zcash (ZEC)?\n\nZcash is a high-ranking cryptocurrency available on a number of major exchanges, some of which are:\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/)\n*   [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)\n*   [BKEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bkex/)\n*   [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)",zec,,"mineable, pow, equihash, medium-of-exchange, privacy, zero-knowledge-proofs, binance-chain, boostvc-portfolio, dcg-portfolio, electric-capital-portfolio, fenbushi-capital-portfolio, hashkey-capital-portfolio, winklevoss-capital, placeholder-ventures-portfolio, pantera-capital-portfolio","Mineable, PoW, Equihash, Medium of Exchange, Privacy, Zero Knowledge Proofs, Binance Chain, BoostVC Portfolio, DCG Portfolio, Electric Capital Portfolio, Fenbushi Capital Portfolio, Hashkey Capital Portfolio, Winklevoss Capital, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio, Pantera Capital Portfolio",https://z.cash/,https://twitter.com/electriccoinco,https://forum.z.cash/,"https://t.me/Zcash_Community, https://z.cash/","https://explorer.zcha.in/, https://zcash.tokenview.com/, https://blockchair.com/zcash, https://bscscan.com/token/0x1ba42e5193dfa8b03d15dd1b86a3113bbbef8eeb",https://reddit.com/r/zec,https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf,https://github.com/zcash/zcash,,,2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,,True

1518,Maker,maker,MKR,active,token,"## What Is Maker (MKR)?\n\nMaker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol — respectively a [decentralized organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) and a software platform, both based on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain — that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.\n\nInitially conceived in 2015 and fully launched in December 2017, Maker is a project whose task is to operate DAI, a community-managed decentralized cryptocurrency with a stable value soft-pegged to the US dollar.\n\nMKR tokens act as a kind of voting share for the organization that manages DAI; while they do not pay dividends to their holders, they do give the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol and are expected to appreciate in value in accordance with the success of DAI itself.\n\nThe Maker ecosystem is one of the earliest projects on the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) scene: the industry that seeks to build decentralized financial products on top of smart-contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Maker?\n\nMakerDAO, the first entity inside the larger Maker ecosystem, was created in 2015 by Rune Christensen, an entrepreneur from Sealand, Denmark.\n\nChristensen graduated from Copenhagen University with a degree in biochemistry and studied international business at the Copenhagen Business School. Prior to MakerDAO, he co-founded and managed the Try China international recruiting company.\n\n\n#### What Makes Maker Unique?\n\nAs of October 2020, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose prices are pegged to the USD or another traditional currency). It is the 25th largest cryptocurrency at over $800 million in market capitalization and it has more active addresses than USDT — the largest stablecoin on the market.\n\nMKR’s unique proposition lies in the fact that it allows its holders to directly participate in the process of governing DAI. Every holder of Maker tokens has the right to vote on a number of changes to the Maker Protocol, with their voting power depending on the size of their MKR stake. Some of the aspects of the protocol the holders can vote on are:\n\n* Adding new collateral asset types to the protocol, allowing users to submit new cryptocurrencies to mint more DAI;\n* Amend the risk parameters of existing collateral asset types;\n* Change the DAI Savings Rate: holders of DAI tokens can earn savings by locking them in a special contract, and the Savings Rate impacts the profitability of that contract;\n*   Choose the oracles — entities whose goal is to supply trustworthy off-blockchain data to the Maker ecosystem;\n* Upgrades to the platform.\n\nThis ability to participate in the management of one of the largest stablecoins on the market is what drives the demand for MKR tokens and correspondingly affects their value.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFind out more about [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), another USD-pegged stable cryptocurrency\n\nLearn more about [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) on CMC [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), our educational portal.\n\n\n#### How Many Maker [MKR] Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe issuance and removal of MKR from the system is governed by a complex system of interdependent mechanisms designed to ensure that DAI is always fully collateralized by other cryptocurrency assets and its soft peg to the USD is maintained. There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of MKR.\n\nDAI’s value is secured by collateral — other cryptocurrencies that are deposited by users when minting new DAI tokens and stored in so-called vaults — [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDuring price downswings, the value of crypto stored in the vault might become insufficient to fully collateralize the corresponding amount of DAI. In that case, the Maker Protocol automatically initiates the liquidation of the vault’s contents, the proceeds of which it uses to cover that vault’s obligations. If the amount of DAI generated during the liquidation is not enough, the Maker Protocol mints new MKR tokens to sell and cover the remaining sum, thereby increasing the total supply.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the amount of DAI made from the auctions exceeds the necessary limit to ensure full collateralizations — then, it is used by the Maker Protocol to buy back and burn MKR tokens, decreasing their total supply.\n\nThus, the supply of MKR is a dynamic value that changes depending on market conditions and the overall health of the DAI ecosystem. As of October 2020, the circulating supply of Maker tokens is about 1 million, worth more than $500 million.\n\n\n### How Is the Maker Network Secured?\n\nMKR is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, meaning that it runs on and is secured by the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). Ethereum, in turn, is secured by its Ethash [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) function.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Maker (MKR)?\n\nMaker token trading is available on such exchanges as:\n\n* [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n* [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)\n* [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)\n* [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)",MakerDAO,,"store-of-value, defi, dao, polychain-capital-portfolio, governance, lending-borowing, dragonfly-capital-portfolio, electric-capital-portfolio, a16z-portfolio, 1confirmation-portfolio, placeholder-ventures-portfolio, pantera-capital-portfolio, paradigm-xzy-screener","Store of Value, DeFi, DAO, Polychain Capital Portfolio, Governance, Lending / Borrowing, DragonFly Capital Portfolio, Electric Capital Portfolio, A16Z Portfolio, 1Confirmation Portfolio, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio, Pantera Capital Portfolio, Paradigm XZY Screener",https://makerdao.com/,https://twitter.com/MakerDAO,,https://t.me/makerdaoOfficial,"https://etherscan.io/token/Maker, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2, https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xda27b988921a0659bceac1abd4b43a295c8296f4, https://eth.tokenview.com/en/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2",https://reddit.com/r/MakerDAO,https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#overview-of-the-dai-stablecoin-system,,,1027,2017-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,,True

Blockchain is utilized to organize a market network where people can monetize their computing power as well as applications and even datasets. \n\nIt does this by providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources. IExec can support applications in fields such as big data, healthcare, AI, rendering and fintech. IExec was founded on Oct. 16, 2016, with the goal to reinvent cloud computing through the creation of a new cloud computing paradigm. \n\nAs such, iExec relies on the XtremWeb-HEP, an open-source desktop grid software that implements features such as multi-applications, fault-tolerance, multi-users, deployment of virtual images, private infrastructure, data management, security and much more.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of iExec RLC?\n\nWhen it comes to the Founders of iExec RLC, Gilles Fedak is the CEO and co-founder. Before he began work on iExec, he worked in INRIA as a research scientist at a postdoc in UC San Diego and at ATER at University Paris-Sud. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy and computer science.\n\nHaiwu He is the co-founder and head of APAC at iExec. Before that, he was a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an innovation transfer research engineer at ENS Lyon, the co-founder of iRentCPU, a research engineer expert at INRA and an assistant professor at Hohai University.  He has a Ph.D. in computing sciences. \n\nThis means that iExec is built upon the work of team members who have done INRIA and CNRS research in the field of desktop grid computing.\n\n\n## What Makes iExec RLC Unique?\n\nThe iExec network has been made up of computing resource providers. These are known as iExec Workers. If users want to be these workers, they can connect their machines and will be rewarded with RLC tokens for contributing their resources to the network. \n\nApplication providers can monetize their algorithms, and data providers that own valuable datasets can make them available for usage through iExec. Then there is also the consensus protocol known as PoCo or proof-of-contribution that provides consensus over the off-chain computing. Thanks to this proof-of-contribution, external resources providers have the usage of their resources certified on the blockchain itself.\n\nIExec also provides distributed applications running on the blockchain known as [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) scalable secure and easy access to servers, data-sets and computing resources, and since all of this works on Ethereum, it allows for a Virtual Cloud Infrastructure that can provide high-performance computing services on demand.\n\nAs such, iExec supports the emerging class of blockchain-based distributed applications and enables cost-effective, high-performance computing through a decentralized cloud infrastructure.

1732,Numeraire,numeraire,NMR,active,token,"## What Is Numeraire (NMR)?\n\nNumerai is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-based platform allowing developers and data scientists to experiment and create machine learning models with improved reliability. The platform’s main goal is to bring decentralization to the data science field and allow developers to compete in creating effective machine learning prediction models. \n\nFounded in late 2015 in San Francisco, Numerai claims to be the first hedge fund to launch a cryptocurrency on the market. Unlike traditional hedge funds, however, Numerai relies on the data and predictions produced by tournament participants to participate in the stock market. They claim to be the first hedge fund to use machine learning so heavily in its investment strategy. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Numeraire?\n\nRichard Craib is the founder and CEO of Numerai. He graduated from the University of Cape Town in 2008 and later acquired one more bachelor’s degree from Cornell University, and spent a year in UC Berkeley. His professional career started with founding Numerai and has taken him to a Forbes 30 under 30 designee position. \n\nRichard Craib is often cited for his innovative approach to hedge fund management and the revolutionary idea to rely so heavily on artificial intelligence for stock price prediction. Not only that, Numerai has created one of the largest global data science tournaments.\n\n\n#### What Makes Numeraire Unique?\n\nNumerai and the Numeraire token are unique in terms of the idea behind their creation. This is reportedly the first cryptocurrency to be created and released by a hedge fund. One of the main benefits of the NMR token is that it is awarded to data scientists whose models perform well in the Numerai tournament. This means that the token becomes more valuable as more people enter the tournament and start competing.\n\nNot only that, but the models ventured for the tournament allow Numerai to actively participate in stock market trading based on the results revealed by participating projects. This innovative approach to stock trading makes Numerai one of the few hedge funds to rely significantly on AI-generated data predictions. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).\n\nFind out more about [Tellor](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tellor/).\n\nLearn more about [networks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/network).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Numeraire (NMR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe maximum supply of NMR is 11,000,000 tokens. The supply cap for Numeraire was initially 21 million tokens; however, the platform announced that it is going to cut this maximum by more than half in 2019. \n\nIn a 2018 press release, Numerai announced that three million NMR tokens will remain locked until 2028, and will be released as a reward incentive for tournament participants. The Numeraire token did not undergo an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-an-ico)). Instead, Numerai decided to distribute 1 million NMR tokens among 12,000 platform users with the highest activity statistics. \n\nNMR tokens are burned on a weekly basis, as tournament participants who venture losing models and predictions lose their stake in the competition.\n\n\n### How Is the Numeraire Network Secured?\n\nAs an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, NMR is secured by the Ethereum proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. This means that validators and block creators are selected based on the amount of NMR tokens they are currently staking. ERC-20 tokens are becoming increasingly popular as they offer higher versatility in terms of use. However, the Ethereum blockchain still provides the same level of protection as blockchains operating with other security protocols.\n\nUnlike other popular consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)), PoS does not rely on high consumption of electrical or computing power to create new tokens. This makes the consensus much more scalable and easily incorporated in different use cases. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Numeraire (NMR)?\n\nNumeraire is growing in popularity, as the hedge fund performs better, and more data scientists are participating in the weekly tournament. If you are looking to trade NMR, there are a number of exchanges now offering the token.\n\n[Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) has the highest trading volume for NMR/USD as of February 2021. Other relevant exchanges with high trading volumes include [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [DigiFinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/digifinex/), and [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/).\n\n[Read more](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying crypto here.\n",numerai,,"asset-management, ai-big-data, defi, payments, research, coinfund-portfolio, usv-portfolio, placeholder-ventures-portfolio, paradigm-xzy-screener","Asset management, AI & Big Data, DeFi, Payments, Research, Coinfund Portfolio, USV Portfolio, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio, Paradigm XZY Screener",https://numer.ai/,https://twitter.com/numerai,https://forum.numer.ai/,https://t.me/NMR_Official,"https://etherscan.io/token/0x1776e1F26f98b1A5dF9cD347953a26dd3Cb46671, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1776e1f26f98b1a5df9cd347953a26dd3cb46671",https://reddit.com/r/numerai,https://numer.ai/whitepaper.pdf,https://github.com/numerai,,1027,2017-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,,True
1765,EOS,eos,EOS,active,coin,"## What Is EOS?\n\nEOS is a platform that’s designed to allow developers to build decentralized apps (otherwise known as [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) for short.)\n\nThe project’s goal is relatively simple: to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace blockchain technology — and ensure that the network is easier to use than rivals. As a result, tools and a range of educational resources are provided to support developers who want to build functional apps quickly.\n\nOther priorities include delivering greater levels of scalability than other blockchains, some of which can only handle less than a dozen transactions per second.\n\nEOS also aims to improve the experience for users and businesses. While the project tries to deliver greater security and less friction for consumers, it also vies to unlock flexibility and compliance for enterprises.\n\nThe blockchain launched back in June 2018.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of EOS?\n\nThe EOS platform was developed by the company Block.one, and its white paper was authored by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer.\n\nBoth men continue to be members of Block.one’s executive team, with Blumer serving as CEO and Daniel Larimer as CTO.\n\nBlumer is a serial entrepreneur, and one of his earliest ventures involved selling virtual assets for video games. He went on to co-found Okay.com, a digitally focused real estate agency in Hong Kong.\n\nLarimer is a software programmer who has also started a series of crypto ventures. They include the crypto trading platform BitShares and the Steem blockchain.\n\nThe pair met in 2016 and formed Block.one the following year.\n\n### What Makes EOS Unique?\n\nTo an extent, you could argue that EOS aims to create familiarity for its users. Whereas EOS.IO is probably best compared to an operating system like Windows or iOS, EOS is the cryptocurrency that drives the network.\n\nAccording to the company, it has the capacity to accommodate the demands of hundreds, if not thousands, of DApps — even if they were being used by substantial numbers of people. Parallel execution, as well as a modular approach, are said to drive this efficiency.\n\nIn a unique twist, token holders have the ability to vote for block producers — as well as other matters such as protocol upgrades.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the most distinguishing features of EOS are those that certain critics dislike the least. There are those that argue that extensive Block.one’s involvement with this project means it’s rather centralized — and some argue this is the opposite of what blockchains and cryptocurrencies were meant to achieve.\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[Basics, how-to guides and deep dives: Learn about crypto with CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\n[Find out the meaning of crypto and blockchain terms in our glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\n[What is Steem?](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/)\n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: In-depth news, features and analysis](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n### How Many EOS Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere are 936 million EOS coins in circulation at the time of writing, and a total supply of 1.02 billion tokens.\n\nBlock.one held an initial coin offering for EOS back in June 2017 and it lasted for a year — that’s substantially longer than many of the ICOs seen at the time.\n\nA total of $4.02 billion was raised in the process, and investors from the U.S. were unable to take part. Looking at the breakdown of how tokens were distributed, 10% were allocated to the founders, while 90% were distributed among investors. \n\nIt is worth noting that Block.one won’t receive this allocation straightaway — instead, it’ll happen over a 10-year period.\n\n### How Is the EOS Network Secured?\n\nEOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This concept was conceived by Larimer, and aims to solve some of the flaws that are seen in PoW and PoS systems.\n\nAs we briefly explained earlier, those who own EOS tokens are able to vote for representatives who will be responsible for validating transactions. One of the advantages is that this helps eliminate consolidation, where smaller miners are pushed out by those who have greater levels of computing power and resources.\n\n### Where Can You Buy EOS?\n\nIt is possible to [buy EOS](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-EOS) through Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and countless other exchanges. Given how widely used it is in the crypto industry, you’ll probably be hard pressed to find a trading platform that doesn’t support it.

1831,Bitcoin Cash,bitcoin-cash,BCH,active,coin,"### What is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p) electronic cash system that aims to become sound global money with fast payments, micro fees, privacy, and high transaction capacity (big blocks). In the same way that physical money, such as a dollar bill, is handed directly to the person being paid, Bitcoin Cash payments are sent directly from one person to another.\n\nAs a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. Unlike traditional fiat money, Bitcoin Cash does not depend on monetary middlemen such as banks and payment processors. Transactions cannot be censored by governments or other centralized corporations. Similarly, funds cannot be seized or frozen — because financial third parties have no control over the Bitcoin Cash network. \n\n### What is Bitcoin Cash used for?\n\nBitcoin Cash combines gold-like scarcity with the spendable nature of cash. With a limited total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin Cash is provably scarce and, like physical cash, can be easily spent. Transactions are fast with transaction fees typically less than a tenth of a cent. Anybody can accept Bitcoin Cash payments with a smartphone or computer.\n\nBitcoin Cash has various use cases. In addition to peer-to-peer payments between individuals, Bitcoin Cash can be used to pay participating merchants for goods and services in-store and online. Very low fees enable new micro-transaction economies, such as tipping content creators and rewarding app users a few cents. Bitcoin Cash also reduces the fees and settlement times for remittances and cross-border trade. Other use cases include tokens, simplified smart contracts, and private payments with tools such as CashShuffle and CashFusion.\n\n\n### Is Bitcoin Cash different from Bitcoin?\n\nIn 2017, the Bitcoin project and its community split in two over concerns about Bitcoin’s scalability. The result was a hard fork which created Bitcoin Cash, a new cryptocurrency considered by supporters to be the legitimate continuation of the Bitcoin project as [peer-to-peer electronic cash](http://bch.info/bitcoin.pdf). All Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork (block 478,558) automatically became owners of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin, which was invented by the pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakomoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto) remains a separate cryptocurrency.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoin Cash aims to scale so it can meet the demands of a global payment system. At the time of the split, the Bitcoin Cash block size was increased from 1MB to 8MB. An increased block size means Bitcoin Cash can now handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) while keeping fees extremely low, solving the issues of payment delays and high fees experienced by some users on the Bitcoin BTC network. \n\nAs of November 2020, Bitcoin Cash has a block size of 32MB.\n\n### How do you mine Bitcoin Cash?\n\nMining is the process in which new Bitcoin Cash transactions are confirmed and new blocks are added to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Miners use computing power and electricity to solve complex puzzles. By doing so, they gain the ability to produce new blocks of transactions. If one of their blocks is accepted by the network, the miner, or mining pool, earns a block reward in the form of newly-issued Bitcoin Cash. \n\nMining is highly competitive. As the price of Bitcoin Cash in the marketplace rises, more miners are incentivized to bring more hash rate into the ever-increasing miner competition to produce blocks and have them accepted by the Bitcoin Cash network. More miners make the network more secure by increasing and distributing the hash rate. This prevents a single miner from having control over the network. \n\nAnyone can mine Bitcoin Cash. Mining requires specialized hardware called mining equipment, which can either be bought or rented. Miners also need to run a full node software (with the majority of miners currently running BCHN) to build blocks and connect to the rest of the Bitcoin Cash network. Mining can be done independently but miners often pool their hash rate together and share proportionally in the earned block rewards. \n\n### How do you buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is available at a variety of crypto exchanges, depending on your region.

1839,Binance Coin,binance-coin,BNB,active,coin,"## What Is Binance Coin (BNB)?\n\nLaunched in July 2017, Binance is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. By aiming to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.\n\nAside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Academy, Trusted Wallet and Research projects, which all employ the powers of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology to bring new-age finance to the world. Binance Coin is an integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Binance Coin?\n\n[Changpeng Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpzhao/) is the founder and CEO of Binance. In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner. \n\nSince 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He became head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched Binance, and he has been the CEO of the company ever since. \n\n[He Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/he-yi-448ab81b7/) is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the largest crypto exchange globally — Binance. \n\n\n#### What Makes Binance Coin Unique?\n\nBinance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant interest as well. \n\nOne of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSince launching the Binance Coin, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the token. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Elrond](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/elrond-egld/).\n\nFind out more about [bZx protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bzx-protocol/).\n\nLearn more about [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-access-dapps-on-your-mobile-phone).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Binance Coin (BNB) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a maximum supply of 170,532,785 BNB coins, of which 153,432,897 are currently in circulation as of April 2021. \n\nAccording to the Binance [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/10/binance-whitepaper), exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB tokens was allocated towards the initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the token. Another 40% of the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team. Finally, the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors. \n\n\n### How Is the Binance Coin Network Secured?\n\nInitially, the Binance coin started as a traditional [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. Later on, the company introduced its own blockchain, and the coins started being issued from the Binance blockchain, secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant ([BFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft)) consensus mechanism.\n\nWhile ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable, and allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart contract functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus, which is far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Binance Coin (BNB)?\n\nAs the dedicated utility token of the Binance exchange, the most straightforward way to acquire BNB coins would be to purchase them through Binance. The original exchange supports the largest variety of trading pairs with BNB, and it also has the best trading rates for the coin. \n\nIf you are looking for alternative exchanges where you can purchase BNB, [FTX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ftx/) is a good choice. Keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, just like investing in any other type of asset. \n\n[Find more information here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying cryptos.\n",binance,,"marketplace, centralized-exchange, payments, binance-smart-chain, alameda-research-portfolio, multicoin-capital-portfolio","Marketplace, Centralized exchange, Payments, Binance Smart Chain, Alameda Research Portfolio, Multicoin Capital Portfolio",https://www.binance.com/,https://twitter.com/binance,,https://t.me/binanceexchange,"https://explorer.binance.org/, https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52, https://bscscan.com/token/0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c, https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xb8c77482e45f1f44de1745f52c74426c631bdd52",https://reddit.com/r/binance,https://whitepaper.io/document/10/binance-whitepaper,,,,2017-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,,True

1896,0x,0x,ZRX,active,token,"## What Is 0x (ZRX)?\n\n0x is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges.\n\n0x achieves this decentralized exchange functionality using a collection of open-source, publicly auditable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) that work together to produce a flexible, low-friction trading protocol that developers can easily weave into their products. \n\nThe protocol is powered by an ERC20 utility token known as ZRX. Nodes that (also known as relayers) host an off-chain order book and offer user-facing applications that present this information and allow users to make, fill and cancel transactions are paid in ZRX tokens (as trading fees). ZRX can also be used to participate in platform governance, helping holders suggest and vote on changes to the protocol. \n\nIn 2019, 0x [announced](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-roadmap-2019-part-4-proposal-for-stake-based-liquidity-incentive-52c16558df29) an overhaul of the ZRX token, adding extra functionality, allowing ZRX holders to delegate their stake to a market maker to earn passive rewards while retaining their voting capacity.  \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of 0x?\n\n0x was founded in 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali. The two co-founders continue to serve the platform, with Will Warren as 0x's CEO, whereas Amir Bandeali is CTO.\n\nThe platform launched following a successful initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in 2017, during which it raised a total of $24 million — with support from prominent investment firms including Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital and FBG Capital. \n\nPrior to the sell-out ICO, Warren worked in several research roles and briefly held the role of technical advisor to [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/). Bandeali, on the other hand, graduated from the University of Illinois with a BSc in Finance and held several trading positions before co-founding 0x. \n\nNow the team is composed of more than 30 individuals, including engineers, researchers and designers who work to update the platform and keep it running smoothly. \n\n\n##  What Makes 0x Unique?\n\nUnlike many other Ethereum decentralized exchange protocols, 0x supports both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC-723) tokens. This means it can be used for the permissionless trading of a wide range of assets, giving holders a way to buy, sell and exchange the vast majority of Ethereum assets through more than a dozen different apps. \n\nThe 0x protocol can be applied to a wide range of use cases, including eBay-style marketplaces for digital goods and services, OTC trading desks, exchange functionality for DeFi protocols and plain-old decentralized exchanges. \n\nAlthough 0x can be used to build highly flexible exchange products, it can also be built into products where asset exchange is a secondary feature — such as for in-game purchases and portfolio management platforms. \n\nOn the 0x protocol, liquidity takers pay a fee in the form of ZRX tokens — this fee is used to incentivize market maker (relayer) liquidity. Users also need to pay a protocol fee in the form of Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for the gas used in any transactions they complete. As an open-source protocol, 0x does not receive any share of this revenue, and is instead supported by ZRX tokens unlocked as team and developer incentives — along with its initial ICO funding. \n\n\n### Related Pages\n\nFind out about [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) — a modern alternative to 0x.\n\nClick [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap) to learn how to use Uniswap as a beginner.\n\nCheck out[ Ferrum Network (FRM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/) — a platform used for building blockchain-based financial products.[ ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/)\n\nStay up to date with the latest news with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n## How Many 0x (ZRX) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike many digital assets, the ZRX token has a fixed maximum supply that will never be exceeded. This is set to 1 billion ZRX. Right now, around three quarters of this maximum supply is already in circulation, and just a small fraction of this is locked up for staking rewards. \n\nUnlike many protocols, 0x has never publicly described the emission rate for new ZRX tokens, making it difficult to say how long it will take until the circulating supply is fully diluted. But with 50% of the circulating supply released when the token launched in August 2017 and 75% of the supply released as of October 2020, this indicates it may achieve full dilution in the early 2020s. \n\nAs per an [early blog entry](https://blog.0xproject.com/announcing-the-0x-token-zrx-launch-d4c097d893c7) by 0x CEO Will Warren, half of the total ZRX token supply was sold to investors in the 2017 ICO, whereas 15% each is reserved for the 0x core development organization and external project development fund, while a further 10% is reserved for the founding team with a four year vesting schedule and one year cliff, and the remaining 10% is retained for early backers and advisors.\n\n\n## How Is the 0x Network Secured?\n\n0x is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is protected against attacks by the combined efforts of the massive Ethereum miner and node network.\n\nAs for the underlying smart contracts, version 3 of the protocol has been audited by several third party firms which checked to see if there were any underlying vulnerabilities, backdoors and redundant functions, including [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/2019/09/0x-v3-exchange/) — no major issues were found. \n\nHowever, a vulnerability was found in the v2.0 smart contract, which was later patched by the 0x core team. This vulnerability was [detected](https://blog.0xproject.com/shut-down-of-0x-exchange-v2-0-contract-and-migration-to-patched-version-6185097a1f39) by an independent researcher and was not exploited. 0x continues to operate a generous bug bounty, to help detect and patch any issues before they can be exploited.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy 0x (ZRX)?\n\nZRX is currently available to trade on well over 200 different exchange platforms, but the most popular ones include [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [BitMax](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitmax/). It can currently be traded against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and South Korean won (KRW). \n\nLooking to convert your fiat to crypto?

1966,Decentraland,decentraland,MANA,active,token,"## What Is Decentraland (MANA)?\n\nDecentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. \n\nIn this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize. \n\nDecentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences. \n\nDecentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Decentraland?\n\nDecentraland was co-founded by Ariel Meilich and Esteban Ordano — both of whom have stepped down from major positions at the project, but still work alongside Decentraland as advisors. \n\nAriel Meilich previously held the role of project lead at Decentraland between 2017 and 2020, and is a serial entrepreneur that has founded several other startups, including an online translation agency and a CRM platform. He also worked as an analyst at Charles River Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture fund. \n\nOn the other hand, Esteban Ordano is Decentraland's former tech lead and has a long and varied history in the cryptocurrency space working as a software engineer at BitPay, Inc., an advisor to [Matic Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/matic-network/) and briefly operated his own smart contract development firm known as Smart Contract Solutions. \n\nEsteban is also credited with co-founding Zeppelin Solutions, an established blockchain technology infrastructure company. \n\nAlthough Ariel and Estaban are no longer leading the project, the development of Decentraland is still ongoing, with efforts being directed by the recently established Decentraland Foundation. \n\n\n#### What Makes Decentraland Unique?\n\nDecentraland is built for content creators, businesses and individuals that are looking for a new artistic medium, business opportunity, or source of entertainment.\n\nIn total, the Decentraland gameworld — termed the “Metaverse” — is divided into 90,601 individual parcels of LAND, each of which is represented by an [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) non-fungible token. Each LAND is exactly 16m x 16m (100 square meters) and can be found at a particular coordinate in the Metaverse. \n\nThough LAND holders are free to develop their plot into whatever they choose, much of the Metaverse is broadly divided into several districts, each of which has a different size and theme. These districts were generated through individual crowdsales for MANA tokens, and parcels of LAND in these districts cannot be traded. \n\nAs of January 2021, the cyberpunk-themed Aetheria is the largest district — comprising a total of 8,008 LAND. \n\nDecentraland is also one of the growing number of projects to use a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) structure for governance decisions. As a result, MANA toker holders are in control of how the Decentraland world behaves, by proposing and voting on policy updates, the specifics of upcoming LAND auctions and the types of content that are allowed with the Metaverse.\n\nBesides being a creative outlet, many Decentraland users currently monetize their LAND through leasing, advertising and paid experiences. Likewise, other users generate an income by creating and selling items on the Decentraland marketplace for MANA tokens. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [AnRKey X (ANRX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/anrkey-x/) — the first game to merge [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance), e-sports, and Web 3.0.\n\nCheck out [Axie Infinity (AXS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/) — a digital pet universe and decentralized trading game.\n\nLearn more about non-fungible tokens with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token#:~:text=Non%2Dfungible%20tokens%20(NFTs),possess%20the%20property%20of%20fungibility.)\n\nGet the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Decentraland (MANA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of January 2021, just north of 1.49 billion MANA tokens were in circulation. This is equivalent to around 68% of the current total supply of 2.19 billion MANA. \n\nThe original total supply was set at 2.8 billion MANA, but has been reduced as more than 600 million MANA have been burned as a result of LAND auctions. \n\nThere is also a range of further burn mechanisms in place to further reduce the circulating supply of MANA, including a 2.5% MANA burn on Decentraland marketplace transactions. \n\nMANA was originally designed to inflate at 8 percent in the first year, decreasing gradually over time to reduce the rate of inflation. But inflation is currently disabled. As per the [Decentraland glossary](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/glossary/), there are no plans to initiate this inflation ""until necessary"".\n\nIn total, 40% of the MANA supply was sold during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). In addition, 20% was reserved to incentivize the community, 20% went to the development team and other early contributors, and the remaining 20% was held by Decentraland. Project lead tokens are no longer vested. \n\n\n### How Is the Decentraland Network Secured?\n\nMANA is an ERC-20 token. This means it is based on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nEthereum is secured by a massive decentralized network of miners, which work together with thousands of nodes to ensure the Ethereum blockchain—and hence the MANA tokens—is protected against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). \n\nAs one of the most battle-tested [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) in current usage, Ethereum is currently the most popular network for crypto tokens that don’t have their own native blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Decentraland (MANA)?\n\nThe MANA token currently benefits from excellent [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) and can be purchased, traded or sold on around 100 different exchange platforms. As of January 2021, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) are among the most liquid exchanges for MANA tokens. A full list of available markets can be found in the “Markets” section. \n\nMANA can currently be traded against [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), and Ethereum (ETH) — and can be purchased with a [range of fiat currencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/), including KRW and USD.

Kin is short for Kinship, since its aim was to strengthen ties within the Kik community. Kik raised around $100 million dollars in the Kin initial coin offering (ICO) in September 2017. In September 2019, Kik said that it would be shutting down its messaging app in order to fight an ongoing lawsuit with the United States Security and Exchange Commission over whether the Kin ICO sold unregistered securities. In October 2019, MediaLab bought Kik messenger, with the goal of preserving Kin.\r\n \r\n### How Does Kin Work?\r\nKin tokens enter circulation via an incentive model referred to as the Kin Rewards Engine, or ""KRE,"" which rewards the developers that create compelling user experiences with Kin based on their engagement. This offers a software monetization model that incentivizes the adoption of new use cases and creation of value for a cryptocurrency, as well as encouraging the exchange of value between users, as opposed to harvesting user data and attention at no benefit to users themselves. This new alternative re-aligns users and developers around a shared digital economy in which the content creators and developers that generate value are the focus, not big-data monopolies.\r\nThe Kin blockchain operates autonomously via a federated consensus model, currently composed of 11+ globally distributed validator nodes, in order to maintain fault tolerance while also allowing for little-to-no fees and fast confirmation speeds. The identities of the node operators are currently private in order to maintain operational security, but these are reportedly independent, reputable digital service providers, with a history of reliable availability and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and algorithmic logic of the Kin Rewards Engine is overseen by the Kin Foundation, a non-profit organization based out of Ontario, Canada. Undistributed Kin is held in an institutional-grade treasury that is controlled via a series of vesting periods, inflation guidelines and fiduciary custody controls that ensure the safe transfer and proper use of funds. Anti-spam and anti-fraud assurances are also provided as a service until such time that the distribution of Kin can be fully automated with those additional safeguards in place. No more than 10 trillion Kin will ever exist in the Kin ecosystem by the end of the distribution period, the large supply meant to allow mass adoption by users around the world while still transacting in whole-number denominations, as opposed to decimal places.\r\n \r\n### Where Can You Buy Kin?\r\nYou can buy Kin at any cryptocurrency exchange that offers the digital currency.

2010,Cardano,cardano,ADA,active,coin,"## What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change.\n\nThe open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.\n\nCardano was founded back in 2017, and the ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.\n\nThe team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity.\n\nCardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Cardano?\n\nCardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain.\n\nIn an interview for[ CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Titans series](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/), Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 — and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students.\n\nAs well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab.\n\n### What Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nCardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be [upgrading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually.\n\nThe project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable — increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.\n\nIn 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain “50 to 100 times more decentralized” than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network.\n\n**Related Pages**:\n\n[Read our interview with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/)\n\n[A deep dive into the technology behind Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0)\n\n[Brush up on complicated crypto terms with our glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\n[Check out our other interviews with crypto heavyweights](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) \n\n[A Deep Dive Into Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-cardano)\n\n[Read our crypto staking guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/crypto-staking-guide-2021)\n\n### How Many Cardano (ADA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA — but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017.\n\nApproximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.\n\nOverall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.\n\n### How Is the Cardano Network Secured?\n\nCardano is secured through an “environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure” PoS protocol that’s known as Ouroboros.\n\nThe project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power — claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nIt is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth.\n\nAn incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Cardano (ADA)?\n\nAs one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in finding a major exchange to [buy Cardano](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Cardano) on including Binance, Bittrex, eToro, and HitBTC.\n\nIf you’re struggling to find a trading pair that unites ADA with your local currency, check out this guide on[ how to convert fiat into Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) — giving you a gateway to buying altcoins.""",cardano,,"mineable, dpos, pos, platform, research, smart-contracts, staking, binance-chain","Mineable, DPoS, PoS, Platform, Research, Smart Contracts, Staking, Binance Chain",https://www.cardano.org,https://twitter.com/cardano,"https://medium.com/feed/cardanorss, https://forum.cardano.org/",https://t.me/Cardano,"https://cardanoexplorer.com/, https://cardanoscan.io/, https://blockchair.com/cardano, https://bscscan.com/token/0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47, https://ada.tokenview.com/en",https://reddit.com/r/cardano,https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/,https://cardanoupdates.com/,https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements,,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,,True
2011,Tezos,tezos,XTZ,active,coin,"## What Is Tezos (XTZ)?\n\nTezos is a blockchain network that’s based on smart contracts, in a way that’s not too dissimilar to Ethereum. However, there’s a big difference: Tezos aims to offer infrastructure that is more advanced — meaning it can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. This is something that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered since they were created. People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers.\n\nThis open-source platform bills itself as “secure, upgradable and built to last” — and says its smart contract language provides the accuracy that is required for high-value use cases. According to Tezos, its approach means that it is futureproof and will “remain state-of-the-art long into the future,” meaning it can embrace developments in blockchain technology.\n\nThe technology underpinning Tezos was first proposed in a white paper that was released in September 2014. After a series of delays, the Tezos mainnet launched four years later.\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Tezos?\n\nArthur Breitman was the man who wrote the Tezos white paper — and in a nod to [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto), he wrote his works under the pen name L. M. Goodman. He argued that one of Bitcoin’s biggest failings was the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from the community who use the network — as well as the fact that new tokens couldn’t be issued through this blockchain.\n\nHe and his wife Kathleen founded a startup called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was tasked with writing the code that would underpin the Tezos protocol. This company was subsequently purchased by the Tezos Foundation to ensure that it owned all of the intellectual property rights relating to the network.\n\n### What Makes Tezos Unique?\n\nAlthough staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.\n\nBakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain’s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority.\n\nTezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency.\n\nBig cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that’s seen too widely across digital assets.\n\n**Related Pages**:\n\n[Read in-depth tech deep dives on CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/tech-deep-dives)\n\n[Glossary: What is staking?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking)\n\n[Discover which cryptos have recently been added to CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/new/)\n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: The latest features and analysis](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n[A Deep Dive Into Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-tezos)\n\n\n### How Many Tezos (XTZ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOur data shows that 743,862,304 XTZ are in circulation at the time of writing.\n\nA token sale for Tezos was held back in July 2017 — and during this ICO, a total of 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH was raised. At the time, this was worth $232 million, securing its place as one of the largest initial coin offerings ever held.\n\nWhile 80% of this initial supply went to investors, 20% was split equally between the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions.\n\nThe mainnet’s launch was delayed by a series of lawsuits from some disgruntled investors, who argued that XTZ amounted to unregistered securities.\n\n### How Is the Tezos Network Secured?\n\nLike other blockchains, Tezos uses a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism.\n\nAnyone can become a validator and contribute to the smooth running of the network by making a security deposit. To incentivize honest behavior, rewards are given to those who work in the best interests of the blockchain — and those who act dishonestly risk losing their stake altogether.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Tezos (XTZ)?\n\nXTZ, otherwise known as “tez” for short, can be purchased from most major exchanges — including Binance, Coinbase and others. Trading pairs unite XTZ with fiat currencies, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.[ If you’re looking to convert fiat into Bitcoin, you can read a comprehensive guide here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)\n\n### About Tezos Nodes\n\n[Tezos Nodes](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/) is a reliability rating public Tezos Bakers and a service for monitoring the state of node performance for non-public Tezos Bakers.\n\nWorking with the baking community, the team developed a baker reliability index that [features 10 key indicators](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/about).

2062,Aion,aion,AION,active,coin,"## What Is Aion (AION)?\n\nAion is the token used to secure and access The Open Application Network (OAN). Launched in 2018 in Canada, The OAN is a public network available to everyone. Managed by The Open Foundation, a registered not-for-profit organization, OAN aims to give the public an environment to create Open Apps.\n\nThe main purpose of The OAN is to facilitate interoperability between different blockchains, thus allowing users and developers to create a variety of applications. By making the AION token the core of the network, OAN enables users to execute [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), store data, and share it between different networks.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Aion?\n\nThe Open Application Network is run by CEO [Matthew Spoke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewspoke/) and COO [Ian Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianchanmoves/). Matthew Spoke is a University of Ottawa graduate and has worked for several blockchain-centric enterprises. He is also the founder of the Blockchain Technology Coalition of Canada. Spoke is also a founding member of Nuco, an enterprise [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) network solution. In 2020, he started working on Moves, an app designed to stimulate the booming gig economy. \n\nIan Chan serves as the COO of OAN. He has several degrees from universities including Harvard and the University of Toronto. Specializing in growth mechanisms for the financial industry, Chan has had a wide array of professional experience. In 1998, he became the senior vice-president of the Thomas Cook Group. Later, he moved on to working at Hewlett Packard, and in 2005 he joined Deloitte. Since 2018, he has been focusing on developing The OAN.\n\n\n#### What Makes Aion Unique?\n\nThe Open Application Network is a disrupting factor in the world of cryptocurrency, as it aims to bridge the gap between different blockchains. The AION token is essentially designed to allow developers and buyers to transfer from one blockchain to the other easily. Not only that, but AION provides for the execution of data transfers and smart contracts on blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/).\n\nThe lack of interoperability between blockchains is still one of the factors preventing the technology from entering the mainstream financial world. AION aims to create a platform that will effectively be able to replace the current way banks are running global finance. The OAN has already partnered with numerous big names in the industry like CryptoCurve, Nodesmith and BlockX Labs. Not only that, but AION is a member of the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Akropolis](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/akropolis/).\n\nFind out more about [Synthetix Network Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/).\n\nLearn more about [altcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/altcoin).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Aion (AION) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a total supply of 487,496,874 AION tokens. Currently, all of the total supply has entered the market and is actively being traded. There is no information on whether OAN plans to release more tokens in the future or if the current total supply will also be the maximum supply for AION. \n\nFounders and other team members received about 40% of the total supply of AION tokens. Another 51.5% of AION tokens were directed towards Token Release Schedule Contracts, which will be gradually made available to the public over time. Finally, the remaining 8.5% of tokens were distributed among private investors interested in the seed phase of AION’s launch. \n\n\n### How Is the Aion Network Secured?\n\nThe OAN blockchain and AION token are secured by a combination of delegated proof-of-stake ([DPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) and proof-of-importance (PoI) consensus methods. One important characteristic of the blockchain is that it relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance for additional security. \n\nDPoS is a relatively new consensus mechanism, which relies on stakeholders for the validation of new blocks, and thus, the creation of new tokens. Unlike the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) consensus, which requires a lot of computing and electrical power for the mining process, PoS consensus mechanisms are more scalable and environmentally friendly. By placing importance on the number of coins staked. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Aion (AION)?\n\nYou can purchase AION tokens on several of the largest exchanges. \n\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) has the largest processed volume of AION/USD transactions at $8,419,408 as of February 2021.

2130,Enjin Coin,enjin-coin,ENJ,active,token,"## What Is Enjin Coin (ENJ)?\n\nEnjin Coin is a project of Enjin, a company that provides an ecosystem of interconnected, [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based gaming products. Enjin's flagship offering is the Enjin Network, a social gaming platform through which users can create websites and clans, chat, and host virtual item stores.\n\nEnjin allows game developers to tokenize in-game items on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. It uses Enjin Coin, an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, to back the digital assets issued using its platform, meaning that items can be bought, sold and traded with real-world value.\n\nEnjin Coin was first [announced](https://blog.enjin.io/announcing-enjin-coin/) in July 2017, and it [launched](https://blog.enjin.io/enjin-coin-smart-contracts-live-on-mainnet/) on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2018.\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is a digital store of value used to back the value of blockchain assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nEvery asset minted with the Enjin Platform contains ENJ, a minting resource which is locked inside NFTs and removed from circulation. Minting blockchain assets with ENJ provides a variety of benefits to creators and users:\n\n* Infuses them with a reserve value\n* Ensures their transparency and scarcity\n* Gives them instance liquidity\n* Provides utility in games and apps\n* Anti-inflationary\n* Enjin's ""melting"" functionality allows users to destroy their blockchain assets at any time to retrieve the ENJ value from within.\n\nThe Enjin blockchain ecosystem aims to offer software products that make it easy for everyone to develop, trade, monetize, and market with blockchain.\n\nFounded in 2009, Enjin has roots in the gaming industry, with the company’s first product, a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, growing to 20 million users over the course of a decade.\n\nIn 2017 following an ICO, Enjin established itself as a leading blockchain ecosystem developer, building a suite of software products that enable anyone to easily mint, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets.\n\nEnjin’s co-founder Witek Radomski wrote the code for one of the first ever non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is also the co-author of the ERC-1155 Ethereum token standard.\n\nBuilt on top of an on-chain infrastructure, the Enjin ecosystem enables game developers and businesses of all sizes to use tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency used to back the value of blockchain assets.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Enjin Coin?\n\nEnjin was founded as a gaming community platform in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, with Blagov becoming CEO and assuming responsibility for the creative direction of the company and Radomski serving as chief technical officer, responsible for the technical development of its products. Blagov has [described](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-blagov/) himself as having experience in creative direction, marketing, and software project management and design.\n\nThe idea of introducing blockchain to Enjin was first proposed by Radomski after he became interested in [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) in 2012, eventually [convincing](https://www.investvoyager.com/blog/crypto-talk-radomski/) the company to accept it as a payment option. After learning about Ethereum and [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), he decided he wanted to create his own blockchain-integrated software. Radomski is also the author of the ERC-1155 token standard, a new standard for Ethereum-issued tokens that was [introduced](https://blog.enjin.io/erc-1155-crypto-item-standard/) in June 2018, [finalized](https://blog.enjin.io/erc-1155-token-standard-ethereum/) in June 2019, and is used for minting both fungible and nonfungible tokens.\n\n\n#### What Makes Enjin Coin Unique?\n\nAccording to co-founder Radomski, Enjin Coin is unique in that every token minted with Enjin Platform, the company's blockchain asset development platform that [launched](https://blog.enjin.io/enjin-blockchain-game-development-platform-ethereum/) in February 2020, is directly backed by ENJ, giving in-game items real-world liquidity. Similarly, Blagov has [stated](https://blog.enjincoin.io/enjin-x-binance-ama-61fb0fd21855) that the company is focused on adoption, saying he imagines a future in which millions of gamers use digital items backed by Enjin Coin without even knowing it exists.\n\nEnjin Coin uses a series of smart contracts to which game developers send ENJ to mint new, unique fungible or nonfungible ERC-1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, which [launched](https://blog.enjin.io/enjin-marketplace/) in September 2019, or exchanged for their backing ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, thus making it scarcer.\n\nAccording to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), Enjin Coin [uses](https://cdn.enjin.io/downloads/whitepapers/enjin-coin/en.pdf) a series of both on-chain and off-chain processes. When a transaction is completed within the Enjin ecosystem, a Trusted Platform contacts the users' smart wallets, and the website or game is updated immediately with a placeholder or nontradable version of the digital item until the transaction has been validated by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about [Decentraland](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/), a virtual world where land ownership is backed by cryptocurrency.\n\nLearn about [Atari Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/atari-token/), the cryptocurrency project by iconic video game producer Atari.\n\nWant to know more about initial coin offerings? Read an [in-depth guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-an-ico) on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap's online educational resource.\n\nStay up to date on how blockchain is disrupting the gaming industry with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Enjin Coin (ENJ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nEnjin Coin has a fixed maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. However, as the ecosystem grows and more ENJ is locked into in-game digital assets, the number of coins actually circulating will decrease.\n\nEnjin Coin was first made available for purchase during a presale event in September 2017 in which 400 million ENJ was [sold](https://blog.enjin.io/enjin-coin-pre-sale-sold-out/) for a total of 38,800 [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), worth $12 million at the time, with another 100 million ENJ given away as bonuses. In total, the presale sold and gave away 50% of the total supply. An [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) was held in October 2017, with 300 million ENJ — 30% of the total supply — available for sale. The ICO [raised](https://blog.enjin.io/enjin-coin-ico-success/) 75,041 ETH, [worth](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/enj-mip6-mcd-application-enjin/2639) $18.9 million at the time. Tokens that were not sold during the ICO were locked for six months to be later used for community initiatives and marketing.\n\n10% of the total token supply was [reserved](https://cdn.enjin.io/downloads/whitepapers/enjin-coin/en.pdf) for the company for community initiatives, beta testing, marketing and strategic partnerships, while another 10% was reserved for team members and advisors. Team member tokens were locked for the first six months and vested over a period of 24 months, while advisor tokens were locked for two months and fully released afterward.\n\n\n### How Is the Enjin Coin Network Secured?\n\nEnjin Coin is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that any on-chain ENJ transactions are validated and secured by the Ethereum network using a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm. Miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nThe underlying smart contracts that power Enjin Coin have undergone several audits, including by Ethereum developer Matthew Di Ferrante in [September 2017](https://medium.com/@enjin/enjin-coin-receives-successful-audit-from-ethereum-foundation-dev-vanbex-group-dec5b2c3ddb4), smart-contract auditor and developer ZK Labs in [early 2018](https://blog.enjin.io/quarterly-report-q1-2018/), and Castillo Network in [July 2019](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Auditing/issues/308#issuecomment-508447337).\n\nIn October 2020, Enjin [launched](https://hackerone.com/enjin?type=team) a bug bounty program via information security company HackerOne.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Enjin Coin (ENJ)?\n\nEnjin Coin can be purchased on [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb), [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2) and [Balancer](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/balancer), among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum), and [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) such as [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) and [USD Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin) (USDC). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets.\n\nAre you interested in buying ENJ or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)?

2280,Filecoin,filecoin,FIL,active,coin,"## What Is Filecoin (FIL)?\n\nFilecoin is a decentralized storage system that aims to “store humanity’s most important information.” The project raised $205 million in an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in 2017, and initially planned a launch date for mid-2019. However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020.\n\nThe project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both [proof-of-replication](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-replication) and [proof-of-spacetime](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-spacetime).\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Filecoin?\n\nFilecoin was founded by Juan Benet, who also created the Interplanetary File System. Benet is an American computer scientist who studied at Stanford University. After founding Protocol Labs in May 2014, he attended Y Combinator in the summer of 2014 with the intention of supporting both IPFS and Filecoin, as well as other projects.\n\n\n#### What Makes Filecoin Unique?\n\nFilecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor. \n\nDecentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possible\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nCheck out CMC Alexandria’ [deep dive into Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-storage-a-deep-dive-by-filecoin).\n\nWe’ve also prepared a [list](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics) of the 5 things that decentralized storage aims to fix.\n\nSee terms you don’t know? Check out our [glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary) on Alexandria.\n\n\n#### How Many Filecoin (FIL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nProtocol Labs [describes](https://filecoin.io/blog/introducing-the-filecoin-economy/) Filecoin’s tokenomics, or economic model, as a “market for data” where users can sell their storage space to other users, who are looking to rent. Five stakeholders will be able to trade tokens: developers, clients, miners, token holders and ecosystem partners. There will also be three Filecoin markets, according to Protocol Labs: file storage, file retrieval and on-exchange token trading. \n\nIn fall 2020, 400 miners participated in what was called the “Space Race” testnet phase, increasing Filecoin’s network data capacity by over 325 pebibytes; approximately 3.5 million FIL tokens will be released to the Space Race participants.\n\n\n### How Is the Filecoin Network Secured?\n\nFilecoin is secured through proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime. In the Filecoin network, nodes that are also known as retrieval miners are in competition to serve clients with data as quickly as they can. They are then rewarded with FIL fees, which encourages a network of nodes that want to replicate and preserve files. \n\nStorage miner nodes are constantly competing for contracts to provide storage to clients to a specific length of time. When a storage miner and their client agree on a deal, the storage miner holds the client’s data in a sector and “seals” it to create a unique copy of that sector’s data. Storage miners are rewarded with FIL by clients as deal fees, and these miners can also mine blocks and receive a block reward.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Filecoin (FIL)?\n\nAhead of the Filecoin mainnet launch, [Gemini](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gemini/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/) have announced support for FIL. [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) will list FIL after the mainnet goes live.\n\nFor more information about buying crypto, see CoinMarketCap’s easy guide [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).",,,"mineable, distributed-computing, filesharing, storage, polychain-capital-portfolio, blockchain-capital-portfolio, boostvc-portfolio, dcg-portfolio, hashkey-capital-portfolio, a16z-portfolio, winklevoss-capital, pantera-capital-portfolio","Mineable, Distributed Computing, Filesharing, Storage, Polychain Capital Portfolio, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, BoostVC Portfolio, DCG Portfolio, Hashkey Capital Portfolio, A16Z Portfolio, Winklevoss Capital, Pantera Capital Portfolio",https://filecoin.io/,https://twitter.com/protocollabs,https://filecoin.io/blog,,"https://filfox.io/en?utm_source=cmc, https://bscscan.com/token/0x0d8ce2a99bb6e3b7db580ed848240e4a0f9ae153",,https://docs.filecoin.io/,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2080871.0,,2017-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,2020-10-14T16:00:00.000Z,True

2424,SingularityNET,singularitynet,AGI,active,token,"## What Is SingularityNET (AGI)?\n\nSingularityNET is a [blockchain-powered](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform that allows anybody to easily ""create, share, and monetize"" AI services, thanks to its globally-accessible AI marketplace.\n\nThrough the SingularityNET marketplace, users can browse, test and purchase a huge variety of AI services using the platform’s native utility token — AGI. Moreover, the marketplace represents an outlet AI developers can use to publish and sell their AI tools, and easily track their performance. \n\nThe team behind SingularityNET pioneered the development of an AI known as Sophia, which is described as the ""world's most expressive robot"". SingularityNET’s goal is to enable Sophia to be able to fully understand human language, and continue developing “OpenCog” — an AI framework that is hoped to eventually achieve a state known as “advanced general intelligence,” i.e. human-level artificial intelligence (or beyond). \n\nThe platform was first announced in 2017 and completed an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in December the same year, raising $36 million in just one minute. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of SingularityNET?\n\nSingularityNET has an extensive team largely of AI scientists, developers, researchers and engineers. \n\nIt was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel (SingularityNET's CEO and chief scientist) in addition to Simone Giacomelli and Dr. David Hanson.\n\nDr. Ben Goertzel is an established figure in the AI and robotics industry and has a long distinguished track record of working with advanced technology companies — including Hanson Robotics and the OpenCog Foundation. He also works as Mozi Health's chief scientist and vice chairman for Humanity+.\n\nSimone Giacomelli is an entrepreneur and investor that previously worked for crypto consultancy Cryptodex. He left the SingularityNET project in March 2019 and is now focused on the technology R&D lab Vulpem, which he founded in 2015.\n\nDr. David Hanson is SingularityNET's third co-founder. He has a long and varied history in the robotics industry, working with Disney between 1998 and 2001 before founding several robotics startups — including Human Emulation Robotics, Initiative for Awakening Machines and Hanson Robotics over the last two decades.\n\n\n#### What Makes SingularityNET Unique?\n\nSingularityNET is the first platform that makes it easy for developers to sell their AI tools and libraries and enables buyers to test any AI service provided on the marketplace to see if it meets their needs before making payment. \n\nOn top of this, those in need of specific AI services can also tap SingularityNET’s extensive community of AI specialists through the Request for AI portal (RFAI) — which allows customers to easily commission a new AI tool, while developers can earn AGI tokens by filling these requests. \n\nThe utility of the AGI token has evolved with the development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. In October 2020, SingularityNET launched its SingularityNET Enhancement Proposal (SNEP) feature, enabling AGI holders to vote on changes to the network’s operations. Whereas in March 2020, a staking feature was added, enabling users to stake their tokens \n\nIn a collaboration with Hanson Robotics, SingularityNET recently released a joint venture known as Awakening Health, which develops products that leverage AI for healthcare purposes. Its first product is Grace, a humanoid assistant for the healthcare industry.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck our [Rarible (RARI) ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rarible/)— a decentralized marketplace for non-fungible tokens.\n\nCheck out [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) — the governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange.\n\nLearn about [decentralized exchange (DEXs)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\n\nMeet the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog) — your source for crypto insights, updates, and announcements.\n\n\n#### How Many SingularityNET (AGI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of February 2021, a total of 861.5 million AGI tokens representing 86% of the total supply were in circulation. As such, AGI can be considered largely diluted.\n\nHalf (50%) of the total AGI supply was sold during SingularityNET's 2017 ICO. Beyond this 20% was reserved for early developer and partner incentives, 18% for the core team members (now fully vested), 8% for the SingularityNET foundation for the long-term development of the platform, whereas the last 4% was reserved for security bounties.\n\nSince the total supply is fixed at 1 billion tokens, AGI does not have any inflation. \n\n\n### How Is SingularityNET Network Secured?\n\nAGI is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token. \n\nThis means it’s backed by the Ethereum [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm and battle-tested network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners. To date, the Ethereum network has never been successfully [attacked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and is considered one of the most secure networks currently operating. \n\nThe team behind SingularityNET has hinted that SingularityNET may move to another blockchain in the future, and recently [announced](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-collaborates-with-iohk-to-explore-cardano-agi-synergies-8bd1570ffab2) it was exploring the possibility of launching on the delegated proof-of-stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) [Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy SingularityNET (AGI)?\n\nThe AGI token is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), KuCoin, and HitBTC. It's also available on two of the most popular [DEXs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) — [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and Balancer. Currently, the only available trading pairs for AGI are AGI/BTC, AGI/ETH, and AGI/WETH. \n\nIt is not currently possible to purchase AGI directly with your credit or debit card from any of these exchange platforms, but you may be able to buy [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) first, and then exchange this for AGI.

2469,Zilliqa,zilliqa,ZIL,active,coin,"## What Is Zilliqa (ZIL)?\n\nZilliqa is a public, permissionless [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), and as of October 2020, it also allows for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming).\n\nDevelopment work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet [went live](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-testnet-v1-0-release-codename-red-prawn-27974ca46ecb) in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform [launched](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-mainnet-the-launch-and-beyond-4cd7e113369f) its mainnet.\n\nThe native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Zilliqa?\n\nZilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed.\n\nAround the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing.\n\n\n#### What Makes Zilliqa Unique?\n\nZilliqa [claims](https://www.zilliqa.com/platform) to be the world's first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required.\n\nZilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team [states](https://docs.zilliqa.com/positionpaper.pdf) that the platform ""aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard.""\n\nBoth Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about the largest blockchain to consider incorporating sharding, [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nLearn about [Harmony](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/), another high-throughput, sharded blockchain project.\n\nWant to better understand crypto markets? Read CoinMarketCap's in-depth guide on [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics).\n\nStay up to date on the ins and outs of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Zilliqa (ZIL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nZilliqa has a fixed maximum supply of 21 billion tokens. ZIL was first [made available](https://blog.zilliqa.com/more-details-on-zilliqas-token-generation-event-4e1b78e0cf5a) for sale as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token as a part of a token generation event that concluded in January 2018. The tokens were subsequently transferred to the Zilliqa mainnet in a token-swap event that [concluded](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-successfully-wraps-up-token-swap-f8942e1ce743) in February 2020.\n\nBefore launching, Zilliqa generated 60% of all tokens (12.6 billion ZIL) to be distributed at the token generation event, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion ZIL) will be created through the mining process. Ten percent of all tokens (2.1 billion ZIL) were reserved for Anquan Capital, 12% (2.52 billion ZIL) for Zilliqa Research, and 5% for contemporary and future Zilliqa team members — all of which were announced to be distributed quarterly over a three-year period.\n\nZilliqa is designed such that all tokens will be minted within 10 years, with the block mining reward slowly decreasing. According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the project [aims](https://docs.zilliqa.com/whitepaper.pdf) to have 80% of the tokens (16.8 billion ZIL) mined within the first four years and 20% (4.2 billion ZIL) in the remaining six years.\n\n\n### How Is the Zilliqa Network Secured?\n\nThe Zilliqa network is secured through a practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft), or pBFT, [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) protocol, meaning that at least two-thirds of all nodes must agree that a record is accurate in order for it to be added to the blockchain. Each Zilliqa blockchain shard relies on a group of nodes to confirm a subsection of all the transactions, and once each shard has reached a consensus, a second group of nodes confirms the shards' collective results and adds a new block to the blockchain.\n\nThe network uses elliptic-curve cryptography to secure its consensus protocol and allows for multisignatures. In addition to the pBFT consensus protocol that secures its transaction records, Zilliqa also uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm to assign node identities and generate shards.\n\nZilliqa [developed](https://www.zilliqa.com/language) a new language, Scilla, for its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, Scilla is a safety-focused language intended to automatically identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities at the language-level and make it easier to formally verify the safety of smart contracts through mathematical proofs.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Zilliqa (ZIL)?\n\nZilliqa's native token, ZIL, is listed on several major [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges — including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/) and Bithumb — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAre you interested in buying ZIL or other cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC)?

2566,Ontology,ontology,ONT,active,coin,"## What Is Ontology ($ONT)?\n\nOntology is a high performance, open source blockchain specializing in [digital identity and data](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology). Ontology's unique infrastructure supports robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability, offering businesses the flexibility to design a blockchain that suits their needs. With a suite of decentralized identity and data sharing protocols to enhance speed, security, and trust, Ontology’s features include ONT ID, a mobile digital ID application and DID used throughout the ecosystem, and DDXF, a decentralized data exchange, and collaboration framework\n\nAt its launch, Ontology chose to forego the popular [initial coin offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) model in favor of a series of community distributions and airdrops of its ONT [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), which began life as a NEP-5 token on the [NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/) blockchain. \n\nThis helped to quickly establish both organic price discovery and a passionate community and helped the project to avoid subsequent regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFor example, for a brief period any person who signed up for the Ontology newsletter received an airdrop of free 1,000 ONT, which reached a value of $10 per token soon after the token became listed on major exchanges like [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/). \n\nOntology [launched its own MainNet](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched) on June 30, 2018 and now operates independently from the NEO blockchain. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Ontology?\n\nOntology was established by Li Jun, Founder of Ontology. During Ontology’s early stages of development, Ontology received technical support from some members of Onchain’s developer team. However, the two have always been officially separate projects pursuing their own goals. \n\n## What Makes Ontology Unique?\n\nOntology offers a variety of real-life use cases and allows businesses to build their own blockchain on top of the Ontology blockchain. \n\nImportantly, Ontology offers more flexibility for enterprises, allowing them to create customized blockchains to fit their specific needs in terms of features like governance and enhanced privacy, functionality that competitors like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and NEO lack by design.\n\nThe ONT chain also helps negate [transaction network fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) by generating and distributing free [Ontology Gas (ONG)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/) to ONT holders based on their holdings. \n\nOntology further provides additional features such as smart contracts, cryptographic identity proofs (ONT ID) and tokenized data (DDXF) that can seamlessly be transferred between different blockchains. \n\nExample: A patient's medical records, subject to strict data privacy laws in most countries, may be utilized across the Ontology network without compromising the integrity and privacy of the patient's data. The medical business that is transferring the confidential data is able to control what is shared with other parties and under which conditions, with no fear of patient data falling into the hands of unauthorized parties. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn more about [NEO (NEO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/).\n\nLearn more about [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). \n\nLearn more about [Ontology Gas (ONG)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/)<sup>.</sup>\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for trending blockchain news and insights. \n\n\n## How Many Ontology (ONT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nOntology has a total coin supply of 1,000,000,000 ONT, of which nearly 80% are currently in circulation. \n\nAt its launch, 15% of ONT tokens were allocated to its core team, 10% to the NEO council, 28% to institutional partners, 10% to its technical community and 25% to the development of its ecosystem.\n\nThese tokens were subject to a strict screening process and various unlocking periods that ran over two years until the end of October 2020. Read more about its [token distribution here](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-ont-token-distribution-and-circulating-supply-da96d5540827). \n\n\n### How Is the Ontology Network Secured?\n\nThe Ontology network is fully decentralized and therefore highly resistant against hacks, which would have to affect over half of the connected devices to make an impact. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Ontology (ONT)?\n\nBoth ONT and ONG are listed and supported by the world’s leading exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), with the exception of Coinbase. It is now possible to purchase cryptocurrencies like Ontology and Bitcoin directly by credit card.

2882,0Chain,0chain,ZCN,active,token,"## What Is 0Chain (ZCN)?\n\n0Chain is a decentralized storage platform founded in July of 2017 with the aim of providing data privacy, protection and even private sharing. 0Chain’s main aim is to help businesses achieve GDRP and CCPA compliance and transparency with zero liability. The main customers are developers and enterprises due to the fact that it offers a single source of truth for documents and a better way to protect data with high performance and no risk.\n\n0Chain is pronounced as zero chain, and it is a decentralized storage platform that aims to makes data breaches impossible and as such can reduce legal discovery and compliance costs.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of 0Chain?\n\nThe founders of 0Chain are Saswata Basu and Tom Austin.\n\nSaswata Basu is the CEO and co-founder of 0Chain. Before that, he was the CTO of GuruHub, and worked as a cloud Architect and developer at the Energous Corporation. He was a cloud consultant in TruePath wireless prior to the above positions.\n\nTom Austin is the co-founder of 0Chain, but is also an associate professor at San Jose State University. He was also a senior software engineer at Knight Ridder Digital, and an intern at the Mozilla Corporation as well as an intern at ESIEA.\n\n\n## What Makes 0Chain Unique?\n\n0Chain is unique in the way through which it tackles one of blockchains biggest issues, scalability. It addresses this in two ways. The first is through storing data off-chain, which in turn avoids congestion issues that arise from too much data being stored and accessed, and the second is due to the fact that it separates this data storage from the tasks of reaching consensus and form block storage. \n\nThe traditional [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus that is used by a wide range of cryptocurrencies out there such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) is energy intensive. This in turn makes the process have quite a large price tag attached to it and tends to centralize mining hubs, as specialized equipment is required in order to mine efficiently. \n\n0Chain combats this by creating consensus and mining blocks through using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This solution is presented by the ZCN token, a cryptocurrency that has its value based on mathematics. Consumers can use the 0Box instead of Dropbox for example for privacy, anonymity and transparency. They can also use 0Wallet to lock and stake their tokens and earn interest as well as service rewards.\n\nThe wallet functions in a way through which it uses the split-key protocol in order to ensure that the assets are fully safe and easy to use. Developers also have the ability to use 0Chain dStorage through an SDK to truly protect customer data and provide a higher level of privacy compliance at a low cost.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Injective Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective-protocol/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\n<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Learn about [governance ZIL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/governance-zil/).</span>\n\n<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Learn about private keys on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/private-keys-the-keys-to-your-crypto).</span>\n\n<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Learn more about cryptocurrency and altcoins on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).</span>\n\n\n### How Many 0Chain (ZCN) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nWhen it comes to 0Chain (ZCN) coins, it has a current trading volume of $1,181,566 USD.

3139,DxChain Token,dxchain-token,DX,active,token,"## What Is DxChain (DX)?\n\nDxChain is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) network designed to facilitate big data processing and machine learning. Beta-launched in 2018, DxChain’s main goal is to allow its users to safely exchange big data sets and potentially benefit from improved analytics based on this data. \n\nDX token generation is based on the value and quality of data users submit through the platform.\n\nWith decentralized data storage, DxChain offers users a secure environment to perform machine learning experiments and tests. Blockchain technology also provides increased computational power for machine learning and big data processing.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of DxChain?\n\n[Allan Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanzhang/) is one of the founding members of DxChain. He graduated in information management from Southeast University in 1999. In 2013 Zhang created Trustlook AI Cybersecurity, where he still serves as CEO. Mr. Zhang was also part of Palo Alto Networks and TELUS Security Solution as a senior vulnerability research engineer.\n\n[James Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesli/) is the other co-founder of DxChain. Li has held positions at Lucent Technologies and nCircle Network Security. In 2013, he joined Allan Zhang in his project Trustlook AI Cybersecurity and in 2018 they started working on DxChain.\n\n\n#### What Makes DxChain Unique?\n\nDxChain is a blockchain platform that allows data scientists to store and exchange large amounts of sensitive data. Because of blockchain’s inherent security and fraud prevention, DxChain is one of the most secure interfaces data scientists can use to work with, send and receive data sets. \n\nDesigned as a data trading platform, DxChain allows users to share confidential data sets without worrying that they will be leaked or distributed without their consent. Not only that, the computational bandwidth DxChain offers makes it easier for data scientists to work with the data sets they purchase through the platform. In this sense, the DxChain platform is an all-in-one data science tool that allows users to acquire and manipulate large data sets.\n\nFinally, the founding team has made sure to completely decentralize the process so that there is no chance for a third party to get access to the data shared on the DxChain platform. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Numeraire](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/numeraire/).\n\nFind out more about [WaykiChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waykichain/).\n\nLearn more about token pre-sales at [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pre-sale).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many DxChain (DX) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total DX token supply is 100,000,000,000, while the max token supply has not been announced as of March 2021.\n\nOf the total token supply, more than 25% was dedicated to the token sale distribution. This sale event included bonuses for prominent investors. Another 3.85% of DX tokens were dedicated to phase one of the marketing campaign, with an additional 1.25% of tokens distributed during the bonus marketing phase.\n\nAround 6.25% of the total token supply was set aside for foundational use, while team members were remunerated with a total of 5% of all DX tokens. About 43% of all minted tokens have been made available as circulating supply.\n\n\n### How Is the DxChain Network Secured?\n\nDxChain utilizes several different levels of consensus compatibility. With a chain-on-chain architecture, the platform relies on a proof-of-spacetime ([PoSt](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-spacetime)) consensus mechanism to secure data storage. On the other hand, the platform also employs provable data possession (PDP) to allow users to migrate data from unsecured servers to the DxChain network.\n\nUnlike traditionally popular consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) and proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)), DxChain relies on diversifying its security and the PoSt consensus mechanism in order to secure the cloud-computing capabilities. PoSt verifies blocks by ensuring that users are still storing the declared data on the blockchain. This consensus mechanism also allows users to verify that they have used storage space on the blockchain over an extended period of time.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy DxChain (DX)?\n\nDX token can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/)\n*   [ProBit Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/)\n*   [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/)\n*   [Bgogo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bgogo/)\n\n[Read more](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying crypto on CoinMarketCap blog.\n",,,"ai-big-data, payments","AI & Big Data, Payments",https://dxchain.com/,https://twitter.com/DxChainNetwork,https://steemit.com/@dxchainnetwork,,"https://etherscan.io/token/0x973e52691176d36453868D9d86572788d27041A9, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x973e52691176d36453868D9d86572788d27041A9",,,https://github.com/DxChainNetwork/godx,,1027,2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,,True

3714,LTO Network,lto-network,LTO,active,coin,"## What Is LTO Network (LTO)?\n\nLTO Network is a hybrid blockchain platform for decentralized workflows and business process automatization. Thanks to a solution based on live contracts, companies can enter into and carry out transactions, exchange information with each other, organize supply chains, delegate data processing and more, simultaneously and without relying on trust.\n\nLTO Network, formerly known as LegalThings One, was established in May 2014 as a subsidiary of Firm24. For several years the main goal of the project has been to implement simple legal transactions on the blockchain. Conceptually, it is based on the interaction between private and public blockchains.\n\nLTO Network provides the following kinds of assistance: the facilitation and control of the entire transaction process, the exchange of information between parties, the creation of business supply chains and the secure transfer of data to third parties.\n\nBy removing the need to depend on the human factor in business transactions, LTO Network is expected to allow companies to focus on improving the efficiency, transparency and security of their business.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of LTO Network?\n\nFirm24 initially began developing LTO Network as LegalThings One in 2014. In 2017, it decided to add blockchain to the product and rebrand it to LTO Network. \n\nRick Schmitz is the CEO and co-founder of LTO Network. Prior to that, he worked in private equity and mergers and acquisitions at Deloitte and PwC. \n\nMartijn Migchelsen is the CFO, COO and co-founder of LTO Network. Previously, he worked as a corporate finance consultant at PwC.\n\nArnold Daniels is another co-founder and lead architect of the project. Before LTO Network, Daniels worked as a lead software engineer at Cloud9.\n\nSven Stam is the CTO of LTO Network. He has a master's degree in artificial intelligence and has been in the industry for 15 years, joining LTO in 2015.\n\nThe advisory group consists of Mike Egorov (founder and CTO at NuCypher), Sandor Klein (VP of sales at Docker), Femke Stroucken (legal consultant at CMS) and Pedro Irujo (Cemex Ventures). \n\n\n#### What Makes LTO Network (LTO) Unique?\n\nThe two key features of LTO Network are easy-to-use live contracts and the implementation of the hybrid blockchain mechanism with anchorage.\n\nThe live contracts allow parties to create mutually beneficial agreements in real-time. When the parties come to an agreement and launch a live contract, the LTO parent system creates a special private blockchain in order to record the history of events and the contract’s current state.\n\nWhen the agreement is fulfilled, one of the parties sends a response to the blockchain, and the other signs it, allowing the node to confirm that the action has taken place. All contract data is available only to its parties.\n\nLive contracts allow users to register actions, add/remove participants and record discussions on the blockchain. They also make it possible to resolve conflicts and insert sub-processes within the framework of an existing agreement.\n\nThe blockchain functionality is divided into two layers: public and private. The private layer is designed for efficient collaboration, data exchange and process automation. In turn, the public layer provides high-level security, thanks to distributed nodes and a reward system.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [Stellar](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/).\n\nRead about [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).\n\nLearn more about ERC-20 tokens with [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-erc-20-tokens-find-out-now-as-the-decentralized-finance-industry-takes-off).\n\nFind out more about cryptocurrencies with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many LTO Network (LTO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLTO tokens, based on Ethereum’s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard, provide liquidity and serve as a bridge for LTO Network customers. LTO can be used as placement on the network, to pay for transactions, or be passively retained for speculative purposes. Its circulating supply is 280,618,533 tokens as of April 2021.\n\nThe maximum supply of tokens is 403 393 276 LTO. They have been allocated as follows: 15% to the ecosystem fund, 10% to the foundation, 17% to the team, 4% to the advisors and contributors, 12% to marketing and partners, 13% to the seed round and 29% to the private and crowd sale.\n\nThere are four types of token holders: integrators and partners who keep the network operational and receive project coins as a reward; clients who use live contracts for transactions; passive stakers — private users who provide their technical capabilities to confirm transactions on the blockchain; inactive holders who are not part of the community and invest in the token for the purpose of future earnings.\n\n\n### How Is the LTO Network Secured?\n\nThe LTO Network is fully compliant with the European Union’s GDPR data protection law. The hybrid LTO framework allows private blockchains to be as scalable as possible while still having the security characteristics of the already widespread public blockchains. LTO Network is secured by the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus algorithm.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy LTO Network (LTO)?\n\nLTO can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)\n*   [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/)\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n*   [Omgfin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/omgfin/)\n*   [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/)\n\nWant to know more about how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

3783,Ankr,ankr,ANKR,active,token,"## What Is Ankr (ANKR)?\n\nAnkr originates as a solution that utilizes shared resources in order to provide easy and affordable blockchain node hosting solutions. It was founded in November in 2017 and during its time on the market, it has built a marketplace for container-based cloud services through the usage of shared resources.\n\nThis in turn provides developers and enterprise clients with the ability to easily deploy blockchain nodes at a much cheaper price when compared to public cloud providers.\n\nAs such, hosting blockchain nodes on Ankr take away any centralization issues and single point of failure.\n\nFurthermore, public blockchains are able to engage in communities and provide further assistance to their networks. Ankr aims to build an infrastructure platform and marketplace for Web3-stack deployment to enable resource providers as well as end-users to connect to [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technologies and [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) applications.\n\nNote that the Ankr proprietary cloud infrastructure operates independently when we compare it to public cloud providers, and that it is completely powered through geographically distributed datacenters to increase its stability and resilience levels. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Ankr?\n\nThe Ankr Network was founded in 2017 at Berkeley University in California as a distributed computing platform that takes advantage of blockchain technologies.Co-founder Chandler Song worked as an engineer at Amazon Web Services and serves as CEO, while the other co-founder Ryan Fang worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.\n\nChandler Song introduced Ryan Fang to Bitcoin and blockchain during their freshman year back in 2014, where he talked him into buying 22 Bitcoin together. In 2017, those bitcoins became the seed that funded the Ankr project.\n\nTogether, they acknowledged the potential of the cloud computing market as an infrastructure that could drive global innovation. This led them on a mission to build a cheaper, decentralized cloud.\n\n\n## What Makes Ankr Unique?\n\nThe Ankr network is created to provide a new blockchain solution that leverages idle computing power from devices and data centers as a whole. \n\nIt is a platform that enables the sharing economy, where any customer can access resources at a more affordable rate, while also providing enterprises with the ability to monetize on their spare computing power that is not being utilized. It is unique in the way that it is the first one to use trusted hardware, and as such this ensures a high level of security. \n\n\n### Related Pages:\n\nFind out about [Bancor (BNT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bancor/).\n\nFind out about [Decentraland (MANA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/).\n\nLearn about cryptocurrency through [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\nRead our latest posts on our [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n## How Many Ankr (ANKR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe current circulating supply of ANKR is set at 6,496,232,711 coins. They are at a trading volume of $49,811,009 USD. Ankr coins have a max supply of 10,000,000,000 ANKR coins. \n\nThe [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/erc20/) and [BEP-2 ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-bep2/)tokens are used in order to provide liquidity and trading on the exchanges, and the native Ankr token Is required to access blockchain functions. \n\n\n## How Is the Ankr Network Secured?\n\nAnkr utilizes verification nodes in the block validation process, and as such can ensure that the quality of the network itself is maintained and that any bad actors are removed from the system.\n\nIn order to ensure that the system remains secure and that only good actors are picked, Ankr employs a reputation-based system. This filters actors based on node contributions. Furthermore, a performance test is used to fairly distribute their differing computational resources based on their workload.\n\nAnkr also employs the intel SGX as its main component. This allows for a high level of security against certain hardware and software attacks due to the fact that it processes executions inside of the hardware itself. \n\nWhen we discuss off-chain data and its processing, there is a Native Oracle System, or NOS for short, that transfers between the on-chain smart contracts as well as the off-chain data. This NOS is secure and requires authentication.\n\nThe Data Source Security itself is handled through TLS 1.2,1.3 and Perfect Forward Security, or PFS. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Ankr (ANKR)?\n\nAnkr is a crypto asset that can be found in many different crypto exchanges. The top crypto exchanges for buying, selling and trading of Ankr (ANKR) include:\n\n[Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/) \n\n[Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb/)\n\n[Houbi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)\n\n[Digifinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/digifinex/) \n\n[Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/), and\n\n[Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)\n\nThe number of exchanges trading Ankr have decent liquidity for Ankr tokens, and will probably not have too much slippage on large block orders as a result.   \n\nHere’s [a step-by-step guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to teach you all about crypto and how to buy your first coins.\n",,,"platform, enterprise-solutions, defi, filesharing, staking, substrate, binance-chain, polkadot-ecosystem, pantera-capital-portfolio","Platform, Enterprise solutions, DeFi, Filesharing, Staking, Substrate, Binance Chain, Polkadot Ecosystem, Pantera Capital Portfolio",https://www.ankr.com/,https://twitter.com/ankr,https://medium.com/ankr-network,"https://t.me/ankrnetwork, https://open.kakao.com/o/g7Knr09","https://etherscan.io/token/0x8290333ceF9e6D528dD5618Fb97a76f268f3EDD4, https://explorer.binance.org/asset/ANKR-E97, https://bscscan.com/token/0xf307910a4c7bbc79691fd374889b36d8531b08e3",,,https://github.com/Ankr-network,,1839,2019-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,,True
3794,Cosmos,cosmos,ATOM,active,coin,"## What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?\n\n In a nutshell, Cosmos bills itself as a project that solves some of the “hardest problems” facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful” [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.\n\nThe project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.\n\nCosmos’ origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Cosmos?\n\nThe co-founders of Tendermint — the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem — were Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman. Although Kwon is still listed as principal architect, he stepped down as CEO in 2020. He maintains he is still a part of the project but is mainly focusing on other initiatives. He has now been replaced as Tendermint’s CEO by Peng Zhong, and the whole board of directors was given quite a substantial refresh. Their goals include enhancing the experience for developers, creating an enthusiastic community for Cosmos and building educational resources so greater numbers of people are aware of what this network is capable of.\n\n### What Makes Cosmos Unique?\n\n\nA major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible.\n\nCosmos is described as “Blockchain 3.0” — and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it’s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result. \n\nScalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they’ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites — or be even better.\n\n[Check out simple definitions for crypto terms in our glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\n[Learn about blockchain basics with CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\n[Read the latest features in our blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n### How Many Cosmos (ATOM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nATOM has a very specific total supply — 260,906,513 to be exact. Of these, at the time of writing, about 203,121,910 were in circulation. It is worth noting that these cryptocurrencies aren’t mined — instead, they are earned through [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking).\n\nTwo private sales were held in January 2017, followed by a public sale in April of that year. This raised a total of $16 million, which is the equivalent of about $0.10 per ATOM.\n \nBreaking down the token distribution, about 80% was allocated to investors, while the remaining 20% was split between two companies: All In Bits and the Interchain Foundation.\n\nCosmos has compared ATOM tokens to the ASICs that are used to mine Bitcoin. As a technical paper written by the Tendermint team explained: “It is a piece of virtualized hardware (economic capital) that you need to obtain in order to participate as a keeper in the network.”\n\n\n### How Is the Cosmos Network Secured?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Validator nodes that stake a higher quantity of ATOM tokens are more likely to be chosen to verify transactions and earn rewards. Nodes that are found to be acting dishonestly are penalized — and they can end up losing the tokens that they had at stake.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Cosmos (ATOM)?\n\nGiven the size of Cosmos, it is now available across a number of major exchanges — including big names such as Binance, Coinbase and OKEx.

3911,Ocean Protocol,ocean-protocol,OCEAN,active,token,"## What Is Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)?\n\nOcean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and businesses to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it through the use of [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) based datatokens. \n\nThrough Ocean Protocol, publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas consumers can now access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. These datasets can be discovered on the Ocean Market, where they can be purchased and later consumed or sold.\n\nOn Ocean Protocol, each data service is represented by a unique datatoken, which is used to wrap a dataset or compute-to-data service — this essentially allows third-parties to perform operations on the data without it ever leaving the secure enclave of the publisher. \n\nOCEAN is a utility token that is used for community governance and [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) on data, in addition to buying and selling data as the basic unit of exchange on the Ocean Market. The price of these datatokens is set by an OCEAN-datatoken [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) pool, which adjusts the price of the datatoken as it is bought and sold based on supply and demand. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ocean Protocol?\n\nOcean Protocol was co-founded in 2017 by an experienced group of consultants and entrepreneurs, who together have a wealth of experience in developing and growing high tech businesses. \n\nThe Ocean Protocol core team includes: Bruce Pon, an experienced international project manager and current CEO of BigchainDB; Trent McConaghy, an experienced engineer and AI expert; Cristina Pon, marketing director at both Ocean Protocol and BigchainDB; and Razvan Olteanu, who has more than 20 years of technical and management experience in senior roles. \n\nThe Ocean Protocol core team is currently composed of 15 individuals, and the platform is supported by a massive list of advisors — many of which are experts in AI, [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), big data and business, and have developed and managed their own successful companies.\n\n\n#### What Makes Ocean Protocol Unique?\n\nOcean Protocol unlocks access to data that would previously be unavailable or challenging to access, by allowing anybody with sought-after datasets to tokenize their data and make it available on the Ocean Market. \n\nThis produces an additional income stream for data publishers while giving scientists, researchers, data analysts and anybody else access to more reliable data. \n\nOcean Protocol provides the tools needed for firms to build and launch their own data markets, by either directly forking the Ocean Protocol, or by using the supplied Ocean Protocol React hooks. It also provides extensive documentation to assist with this process.\n\nHolders of OCEAN tokens can directly participate in the datatoken economy by staking their tokens on datasets on the Ocean Market. Stakers then become l[iquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) in the selected OCEAN-datatoken pool, and earn a fraction of the transaction fees generated by the pool. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) — the governance token of the Uniswap decentralized exchange.\n\nCheck out district0x (DNT) — a network of decentralized marketplaces.\n\nGet up to speed with the latest crypto lingo with the [CoinMarketCap Crypto Glossary.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary)\n\nGet an overview of the current market insights with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of November 2020, a total of 414 million OCEAN tokens are currently in circulation. This is out of a fixed maximum of 1.41 billion tokens, which was set in the new Ocean contract deployed on August 21, 2020.\n\nIt will take a total of 50 years for the full OCEAN supply to be released, whereas a total of ~600 million tokens are expected to be in circulation by May 2022, and 1 billion tokens by January 2031.\n\nOf the total Ocean supply, 20% is allocated to the project founders, 15% to acquirors (SAFTE purchasers), 5% to the Ocean Protocol Foundation and the remaining 60% will be distributed to keepers (those that run Ocean network nodes).\n\n\n### How Is the Ocean Protocol Network Secured?\n\nOCEAN is currently an ERC-20 token operating on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. As a result, it is backed by Ethereum’s extensive [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) mining and node network, which protect it against a variety of [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). \n\nOcean Protocol previously operated on a proof-of-authority (PoA) sidechain, but this was scrapped to ensure datatokens remain compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. \n\nAccording to a 2019 [blog entry](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/making-ocean-protocols-smart-contracts-and-it-s-governance-unstoppable-45cf99dc1b65), Ocean Protocol applied military-grade security practices when designing its smart contracts — ensuring they can be securely upgraded and deployed without opening up any attack vectors. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)?\n\nOcean Protocol (OCEAN) tokens can currently be traded on more than two dozen exchanges, including several top tier platforms — like Binance, KuCoin, Bittrex and Poloniex. As of November 2020, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) is the most liquid centralized exchange for OCEAN, whereas [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) is the most liquid decentralized exchange for OCEAN. \n\nOCEAN currently cannot be purchased directly with fiat currencies on any supported exchanges. But you can [buy Bitcoin with fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) instead, and then exchange this to OCEAN.",oceanprotocol,"On September 27, 2020 Ocean Protocol Foundation initiated a hard fork.

4279,Swipe,swipe,SXP,active,token,"## What Is Swipe (SXP)?\n\nSwipe is a platform that looks to form a bridge between the fiat and cryptocurrency worlds with its three main existing products: the Swipe multi-asset mobile wallet, the Swipe cryptocurrency-funded debit card and the Swipe Token (SXP). \n\nThe Swipe wallet acts as the main access point to the Swipe ecosystem and can be used to store and manage a wide variety of assets — including both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. The wallet can also be used to manage Swipe's second product — the Swipe debit card. This debit allows users to spend their cryptocurrencies at Visa payment terminals and comes in a variety of flavors, each of which offer increasing perks and benefits.\n\nThis ecosystem is powered by the Swipe Token (SXP), which functions as the fuel for the Swipe Network, and is used for paying transaction fees. Holders of SXP tokens are eligible for exclusive discounts on the Swipe app and the token can be used for making fiat payments with the Swipe debit card. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Swipe?\n\nSwipe was founded by Joselito Lizarondo, an early [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) investor and individual with a wealth of experience in startup businesses. Lizarondo currently serves as CEO of the platform. \n\nIn addition, former senior creator at Vibial Group John Khenneth is the Swipe’s COO, while Anecita Sotomil — a former tax and legal officer at PricewaterhouseCoopers — is its chief legal officer (CLO). Lastly, the Swipe executive team is rounded out with newly added CTO Henry Niduaza, an accomplished two-time CTO with more than thirty years of experience in banks, retail and fintech. \n\nThe entire Swipe team comprises just over a dozen individuals, including developers, engineers, marketing and community management staff. Swipe is the first crypto-oriented position for the majority of current team members. \n\nIn July 2020, it was announced that Swipe was acquired by [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) — one of the world's leading digital asset exchanges — for an undisclosed sum.\n\n\n#### What Makes Swipe Unique?\n\nSwipe is designed to allow users to take full control over both their crypto and fiat finances through its easy to use mobile application and associated range of crypto debit cards.\n\nOne of its key distinguishing features is its usability. Swipe is designed to be accessible to users of all experience levels, making it a simple task to store and manage cryptocurrencies on the Swipe wallet app, or spend cryptocurrencies using the Swipe Visa debit card.\n\nAs previously touched on, the Swipe (SXP) token sits at the core of the Swipe ecosystem. Users will need to hold a fixed minimum amount of SXP to be eligible to purchase a Swipe Sky, Steel or Slate debit card — and hence benefit from the perks these offer, such as up to 8% cash back on purchases, improved spending limits and zero foreign transaction fees. \n\nBy making it extremely simple to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat, which can then be spent using the Swipe debit card, Swipe targets the increasing number of cryptocurrency holders looking to use their assets for everyday purchases. It also generates revenue from transaction and exchange fees, which is used to support the expansion of the ecosystem and its rollout to new regions. \n\nBesides unlocking a variety of perks for holders, SXP can also be used for creating and voting on governance proposals, allowing holders to help shape the development of the Swipe ecosystem. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [MCO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com/) — a utility token launched by crypto debit card provider Crypto.com.\n\nCheck out the [NEXO token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nexo/) — a token used to unlock better interest rates at Nexo.\n\nWant to learn more about crypto debit cards?

As of November 2020, just over a quarter of this is already in circulation.\n\nAs per the [project white paper](https://www.swipe.io/Whitepaper.pdf), a total of 1.2 million SXP will be made available each month for ecosystem rewards, in addition to a further 600,000 SXP for company operations. On top of this, 10 million SXP will be made available annually for the Swipe team and founders.\n\nA total of 100% of the token supply will be reached by 2028, but this will likely be somewhat lower than 300 million tokens since 80% of all SXP used for transaction and withdrawal fees will be burned. This on-chain burn process will continue until the circulating supply is brought down to 100 million. \n\nSXP holders can also [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their SXP and bond it to the Swipe network to earn a fraction of the network rewards — capped at a total of 40,000 SXP per day. A proportional fraction of this sum is distributed to anybody staking more than 1,000 SXP.\n\n\n### How Is the Swipe Network Secured?\n\nSwipe (SXP) is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, as a result, its integrity is maintained by Ethereum's [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus mechanism and massive node network.\n\nBeyond this, Swipe Wallet users benefit from a $100 million insurance plan offered through Coinbase Custody, and have the ability to lock down their Swipe debit card whenever needed through the Swipe Wallet app. \n\nSwipe is authorized to distribute Visa debit cards in a variety of jurisdictions, including over 30 countries in Europe, but also recently received the green light to launch its wallet and Visa debit card products in the United States. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Swipe (SXP)?\n\nThe Swipe token is currently available to trade on more than 50 different exchanges, including several of the largest and most reputable platforms — including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), KuCoin and Poloniex. \n\nSXP is currently listed against a variety of cryptocurrencies, including [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC) and [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), as well as several fiat currencies, like Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR), and U.S. dollars (USD).

The NFTs will then be available for direct purchase or added by LEXIT pool Managers to various DeFi pools on the platform.\n \n\nAnyone owning intellectual property rights (IPR) to their artwork, music, film/videos, inventions, etc. may submit a listing for approval on the platform free of charge. If approved, the IPR enters the NFT Launchpad as an NFT client.\n \n\nThe NFT offering will be available on the NFT client’s scheduled launch day to pre-subscribed LEXIT platform users who must perform social media tasks on behalf of the NFT client to increase the popularity of the offering.\n \n\nThe NFT then becomes available for direct purchase on the NFT Launchpad to then be available on the LEXIt DeFi Liquidity Pools, which are curated portfolios of various NFTs available on LEXIT. Pools are managed by pool managers and are open to everyone to join. \n \n\nLEXIT pools allow users to participate in potential high yield token pools. Anyone can become a pool manager and create a LEXIT DeFi Pool. Pool managers define the total liquidity and choose a variety of NFTs from the LEXIT marketplace. The pool manager must stake 5% of the pool liquidity to add “skin in the game.” Liquidity can be provided with popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, BNB and the LEXi coin among others trading pairs. \n \n\nLEXIT will also be coming out with its own Protocol, which we are currently far in development with & will call it the LEXNET.

LEXIT started as a project back in 2016 where Amir was trying to monetize on his IPR from tech he created to fund a new idea. He then immediately realized that there is no such place where he can do that,  that was when the idea of LEXIT was born. \n\n \n\nHe instantly thought - what if it were possible to tokenize IPR and make it widely available via a Blockchain ? The idea grew & evolved into the next logical step - a protocol that had the needed performance and flexibility, our LEXNET is the result. Now all that was great but it would be even better if our user could easily access liquidity and so Ferhat (CTO), Frederik and Katia worked hard to figure out how it could be possible, the LEXIT DeFi Liquidity Pools were born. This is us, an powerful NFT Launchpad with integrated DeFi Liquidity on a novel LEXNET Protocol.\n\n \n\nAmir is a serial entrepreneur with 25+ years of experience who began coding at 7 years old. Katia specializes in Business development, Growth in Revenue, Corporate partnerships - with vast experience in growing revenue & developing businesses across various industries.

4679,Band Protocol,band-protocol,BAND,active,token,"## What Is Band Protocol (BAND)?\n\nBand Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that is able to take real-world data and supply it to on-chain applications, while also connecting APIs to smart-contracts to facilitate the exchange of information between on-chain and off-chain data sources. \n\nBy supplying reputable, verifiable real-world data to [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), Band Protocol unlocks a range of new use cases for developers to explore — since they can now use any type of real-world data as part of their [decentralized application (DApp)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) logic, including sports, weather, random numbers, price feed data and more.\n\nBand Protocol initially launched as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) project on the Ethereum blockchain in September 2019, but transitioned to the Cosmos network in June 2020 with the release of Band Protocol 2.0. The new protocol is built on BandChain using the Cosmos SDK. Oracle nodes on BandChain not only relay data but are also involved in block production/validation, giving them a dual role.\n\nBAND is the native token of the Band Protocol ecosystem and is used as collateral by validators involved in fulfilling data requests, as well as the main medium of exchange on BandChain — being used to paying for private data.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Band Protocol?\n\nBand Protocol was founded in 2017 by Soravis Srinawakoon, Paul Chonpimai and Sorawit Suriyakarn. \n\nSoravis Srinawakoon, the current CEO of Band Protocol, is a former software engineer at Ericsson and management consultant at The Boston Consulting Group. Paul Chonpimai, on the other hand, is Band Protocol's CPO, and a former web developer at Turfmapp and engineer at Tripadvisor. Lastly, former software engineer at Dropbox and Quora Sorawit Suriyakarn is Band Protocol's current CTO and a gold medalist competitive programmer.\n\nIn addition to the founding team, the Band Protocol LinkedIn page currently lists a total of 20 additional employees, most of which are scattered throughout Asia, and include designers, developers and engineers. The platform is also supported by major global investors, including Sequoia Capital, Dunamu & Partners, Spartan Group and [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/).\n\n\n#### What Makes Band Protocol Unique?\n\nBand Protocol is designed to be faster and more efficient than competing oracle solutions and is also compatible with most blockchain and [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) development frameworks — ensuring reliable data can be fed to and from multiple different blockchains. \n\nTo achieve its cross-chain data transfer, Band Protocol plans to leverage Cosmos' still in-development Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It remains unclear how long it will take until the IBC is operational and ready for use.\n\nBand Protocol is designed to offer permissionless oracle creation, allowing anybody to start servicing data requests. It also offers extremely simple smart contract integration, allowing developers to begin using data from Band Protocol oracles with just a few lines of code by calling on a predefined interface. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead about [Chainlink (LINK)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) — a competing Oracle provider built on Ethereum.\n\nLearn about [Cosmos (ATOM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) — the blockchain which Band Protocol is built on.\n\nGet up to speed on blockchain Oracles with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-the-all-seeing-eye-that-guides-crypto-networks)\n\nGet the latest tips, tricks, and guides at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Band Protocol (BAND) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBand Protocol originally released the BAND token following an [initial exchange offering (IEO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) on the Binance Launchpad in September 2019. A total of 27.37% of the total supply was sold across three token sale rounds (seed, private, and public sale).\n\nThe total supply of BAND is capped at 100 million tokens. Of this, just over 20% (20.49 million tokens) were in circulation as of November 2020. \n\nOverall, a total of 20% of the BAND token supply is allocated to the team, plus a further 5% to its advisors. 25.63% is allocated to the Band Protocol ecosystem. Based on the projected emission rate, a total of 100% of the total supply should be in circulation by 2025 at the earliest\n\n\n### How Is the Band Protocol Network Secured?\n\nThough BAND tokens were previously based on the ERC-20 standard, they were recently relaunched as native BAND tokens on the Band Protocol mainnet (known as BandChain). \n\nHolders of the older tokens are able to complete a 1:1 swap by depositing their [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) BAND tokens to Binance, and then withdrawing them as native tokens. This will be necessary to participate in BAND staking — which is only available for mainnet tokens. \n\nBased on the Cosmos' SDK, BandChain is secured by a Byzantine fault Tolerance (BFT) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm, which protects it against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). This works in combination with a delegated proof of stake (dPOS) setup, which secures the network’s oracles and allows BAND holders to earn staking rewards for delegating their stake to nodes. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Band Protocol (BAND)?\n\nBAND was first tracked on public exchanges by CoinMarketCap in September 2019. Since then, it has been listed on a wide range of platforms, including several tier 1 exchanges — like Binance, [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/). \n\nThe vast majority of BAND trading pairs are against [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) and [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), but BAND can also be traded against several fiat currencies, including GBP, USD and EUR on Coinbase Pro.

4761,NuCypher,nucypher,NU,active,token,"## What Is NuCypher (NU)?\n\nNuCypher is a decentralized encryption, access control and key management system (KMS), encryption service for public [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). NuCypher offers end-to-end encrypted data sharing on public blockchains and decentralized storage solutions.\n\nNuCypher allows users to share private data between a number of participants in public consensus networks, using proxy re-encryption (PRE) technology. This decryption technology makes NuCypher much more secure and protected than traditional blockchain projects based on public-key encryption, according to NuCypher. \n\nNuCypher (NU) are the native tokens used on the larger NuCypher network. The tokens are used to incentivize network participants for performing key management services and accessing delegation/revocation operations on the network.\n\nThe NU tokens are also used for staking to run a NuCypher worker node. The NuCypher network is protected against malicious staking, and would automatically slash a suspected user’s rewards. \n\nNU is also used on the network for participating in the NuCypher DAO. The NuCypher DAO is the protocol that controls network parameters and smart contract upgrades on the network. Users who stake NU can also participate in validating DAO proposals.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of NuCypher?\n\nNuCypher was co-founded by Mikhail Egorov (the founder of Curve) and MacLane Wilkison. The white paper for NuCypher was first published in June 2017, but the testnet did not launch until November 2018.\n\nEgorov currently serves as the chief technical officer of NuCypher. He is a security researcher, physicist and scientist from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. He is also the co-founder of LoanCoin, a decentralized banking and crowdlending network.\n\nCo-founder MacLane is a software engineer and the CEO of NuCypher. Prior to his involvement in blockchain, he worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, where he provided financial services to enterprises in technology, media and telecommunications. He has also co-founded LoanCoin, along with Mikhail Egorov.\n\nBoth Egorov and MacLane participated in the U.S. startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2016. The following year, the whitepaper for the NuCypher project was published.\n\nNuCypher launched its private testnet in 2018. The private treatment launch saw participation from major staking infrastructure providers including Bison Trails, Figment, InfStones and Staked.us. \n\nThe public testnet of NuCypher began in October 2019. However, the incentivized public testnet began in January 2020. The mainnet of NuCypher launched in October 2020 after distributing $45 million in NU tokens to nodes.\n\n\n## What Makes NuCypher Unique?\n\nUnlike most blockchain projects that are designed to serve customers, better transactions, IoT operations, voting mechanism, and the like, NuCypher was created for other blockchains. NuCypher is a privacy layer for blockchains.\n\nNuCypher provides a privacy infrastructure for the decentralized web with proxy re-encryption (PRE) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technologies.\n\nUsing the NuCypher network, users can conditionally grant and revoke access to data with multiple users at a time. NuCypher's encryption service provides almost unparalleled security for sensitive data transfer. It combines this with the trustless and censorship-resistant nature of conventional public blockchains.\n\nThe cryptographic libraries of NuCypher include;\n\n\n\n*   [pyUmbral](https://github.com/nucypher/pyumbral/), the reference implementation of the Umbral threshold proxy re-encryption scheme;\n*   [NuBLS](https://github.com/nucypher/nubls), a threshold BLS signature library, and\n*   [rust-umbral](https://github.com/nucypher/rust-umbral), a Rust implementation of Umbral with bindings to JavaScript and Python.\n\n\n## How Many NuCypher (NU) Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nAt NuCypher’s mainnet launch in October 2020, there was a total supply of 1 billion NU tokens. According to the release schedule, 3,335,938 and 4,460,000 NU tokens are released monthly to the SAFT Series 2 and Team/Equity investors every month.\n\nThe WorkLock, NuCypher’s novel network node setup mechanism, is expected to get 225,000,000 NU tokens in April 2021. Factoring in the monthly release of the NU tokens, 1,088,876,961 NU tokens have been issued with 392,750,000 currently in circulation.\n\nThe network has a max supply of ~3.89 billion NU tokens. The tokens are released monthly as rewards to stakers, according to the[ staking economics paper](https://github.com/nucypher/whitepaper/blob/master/economics/staking_protocol/NuCypher_Staking_Protocol_Economics.pdf).\n\n\n## How Is the NuCypher Network Secured?\n\nNuCypher is a layer 2 resource allocation protocol on Ethereum that uses a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) mechanism to coordinate worker nodes.\n\nThe network runs on a novel node distribution mechanism which NuCypher calls the WorkLock. To run a NuCypher node, a minimum of 2,000 node operators would need to stake 353,913.\n\nThe minimum lockup staking period is 30 days. However, NuCypher doesn’t guarantee that staking for longer than one year will provide greater benefits in terms of earning rewards. Unless the user opts out after a staking period, staking rewards are automatically restaked after each period.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Nucypher (NU)?\n\nNuCypher (NU) is popular among online exchanges that trade ethereum tokens. The top exchanges where you can buy, sell, and trade NuCypher tokens currently are; \n\n\n\n*   [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)\n*   [UniSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)\n*   [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/)\n*   [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)\n*   [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/)\n*   [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), and \n*   [1inch Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/)\n\nIf you are new, you can find our simplified guide for purchasing crypto and more exchanges where you can trade[ here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n",nucypher,,"polychain-capital-portfolio, coinfund-portfolio, kinetic-capital","Polychain Capital Portfolio, Coinfund Portfolio, Kinetic Capital",https://nucypher.com,https://twitter.com/nucypher,https://blog.nucypher.com/,"https://t.me/nucypher, https://t.me/nucypher_alerts",https://etherscan.io/token/0x4fe83213d56308330ec302a8bd641f1d0113a4cc,https://reddit.com/r/nucypher,https://github.com/nucypher/whitepaper,https://github.com/nucypher/whitepaper,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2035166.0,1027,2019-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,,True
4841,suterusu,suterusu,SUTER,active,token,"## What Is Suterusu (SUTER)?\n\nSuterusu is a project designed to implement and integrate state-of-the-art, zero-knowledge, near constant-size and succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, or ZK-ConSNARK schemes. These schemes make sure a transaction guarantees complete anonymity and confidentiality for both sender and receiver. The project is built on the premise that [zk-SNARK](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks), a technology used to prove and shield possession of information, poses a security risk. The main goal of the project is to champion the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs and anonymize [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cryptocurrency) such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) without compromising security and efficiency. Suterusu’s signature products are Suter Wallet, Suter Virtual Machine (VM), and Suter Shield. Suterusu was launched on Dec. 12, 2018 by a Singaporean team.\n\n\n### Who Are The Founders of Suterusu?\n\nThe core team members of Suterusu are Zhengpeng Hou (CEO), Dr. Huan Ling (CTO) and Dr. Dazhi Guo, the chief strategy officer (CSO) of Suterusu Foundation.\n\nHou, who is also known by his moniker ZP, is an [open-source](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/open-source) expert who first came across this technology in 2000. He has worked for companies such as Ubuntu, which he credits for changing his involvement with the open-source world. He went on to co-found the Ubuntu China community. He finds blockchain fascinating because of its resemblance to open-source software projects. Hou’s areas of specialization include open-source project development, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing.\n\nDr. Lin, alumni of the University of Florida and Shanghai Jaio Tong University, holds Ph.D. degrees in applied [cryptography](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cryptography) and privacy in distributed systems. He previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne and a research assistant at his alma mater, the University of Florida. \n\nDr. Guo is a Ph.D. holder in Economics from the Central University of Finance and Economics (CUFE). He served as a senior research fellow at the Huobi Academy of Blockchain Application. Dr. Guo is experienced in technology trends, investment areas, and blockchain applications.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nLearn more about [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0).\n\nCheck out the CoinMarketCap [blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\nLearn more about [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0).\n\n\n## What Makes Suterusu Unique?\n\nSeveral cryptocurrencies allow people to transact with each other across the globe. However, the transactions are not completely anonymous. Cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous. A person’s real identity can be tracked if their blockchain wallet address is known and they have undergone [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc) verification somewhere.\n\nSeveral cryptocurrencies were created to solve the privacy issue. Some of them use a verification method called zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) to protect the identity of users. This technology has its shortcomings such as the lack of support for [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Suterusu aims to solve this problem through the use of its original ZK-ConSNARK technology.\n\nSuterusu created a product called Suter Shield that enables users to take advantage of privacy payment functionality offered by the Suterusu [protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol).\n\nSuter Shield works in four steps:\n\n\n\n*   Register: Users can register for new Suter accounts by entering a private key. A corresponding public key is issued as an identifier to the new Suter account.\n*   Fund: UserS invoke the fund module by converting their Ether or [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token to Suter-ETH or Suter-ERC-20. Homomorphic public-key encryption is used to add the converted token to the newly created Suter account. The native token is deposited into the fund contract, which resembles a stream feeding into an ocean.\n*   Transfer: Users can send the converted token to a Suter account.\n*   Burn: The burn module converts the Suter token to its original form.\n\nSuterusu use cases include facilitating private [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) payments, proof of identity, and data protection and monetization. Suterusu generates income from charging a 20% handling fee of the Ethereum network cost.\n\n\n### How Many Suterusu (SUTER) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a hard cap of 10 billion SUTER tokens. Of the total supply, 16% were sold in a private fundraising campaign, 3.2% allocated to Suterusu Foundation, 4.8% reserved for the team and the remaining 76% will be used for future [mining](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mining). The investor tokens were locked for a six-month period. Tokens belonging to the Suterusu Foundation and the founding team are locked for a minimum three-year period and the unlocking process will follow a predetermined schedule. The project adopted a deflation-based currency model. The network is maintained by validators who are paid for their work. \n\n\n### How Is the Suterusu Network Secured?\n\nSuterusu protocol adopted the [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) mechanism. The governance mechanism is based on universality, inclusiveness and adaptability. Anyone can become a community member by holding SUTER tokens. The mining power of each miner on the Suterusu protocol is based on the number of SUTER tokens and the length of the holding period. The Suterusu protocol is maintained by token holders and validator nodes.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Suterusu ([SUTER])?\n\nYou can buy SUTER tokens on [CoinSpot](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coin-spot), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/), [MXC.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/) and [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).

4847,Stacks,stacks,STX,active,coin,"\n## What Is Stacks (STX)?\n\nStacks is a layer-1 blockchain solution that is designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) to [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). These smart contracts are brought to Bitcoin without changing any of the features that make it so powerful — including its security and stability. \n\nThese DApps are open and modular, meaning developers can build on top of each other's apps to produce features that are simply not possible in a regular app. Since Stacks uses Bitcoin as a base layer, everything that happens on the network is settled on the most widely used arguably the most secure [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) in operation — Bitcoin.  \n\nThe platform is powered by the Stacks token (STX),  which is used for fueling the execution of smart contracts, processing transactions and registering new digital assets on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. \n\nThe platform was formerly known as Blockstack, but was rebranded to Stacks in Q4 2020 in order to ""separate the ecosystem and open source project from Blockstack PBC"" — the company that built the original protocols.\n\nThe mainnet for Stacks 2.0 launched in January 2021.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Stacks?\n\nStacks was initially funded by a range of prominent venture capital funds, including Y Combinator, Digital Currency Group and Winklevoss Capital. It was developed by Blockstack PBC, which has its headquarters in New York. \n\nBlockstack PBC now operates under the name Hiro Systems PBC and joins a wide range of companies building on Stacks' platform.\n\nBlockstack PBC was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea. After graduating from Princeton University with an MA and PhD in computer science, Muneeb Ali co-founded Stacks in 2013, and still works with the platform today as the CEO of Hiro Systems PBC. \n\nThe second co-founder of the platform, Ryan Shea, also served co-CEO between 2013 and 2018, before disembarking from the project to pursue other ventures — including co-founding a new tech startup that is currently operating in stealth. Prior to his role at Stacks, Shea worked as a software engineer. \n\n\n#### What Makes Stacks Unique?\n\nStacks looks to take what makes Bitcoin so powerful, and extends it with additional functionality, without needing to fork or change the original Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nIt does this by connecting directly with the Bitcoin blockchain through its proof-of-transfer (PoX) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus), which has miners pay in BTC to mint new Stacks (STX) tokens. Moreover, STX token holders can also stack (_not [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking)_) their tokens to earn Bitcoin as a reward. \n\nStacks introduces a new smart contract programming language known as Clarity, which is designed to be both secure and easy to build with thanks to its unambiguous syntax. This smart contract-centric programming language is also used by the [Algorand (ALGO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/) blockchain. \n\nOn top of this, Stacks was the first cryptocurrency to receive SEC qualification for a sale in the United States, allowing it to launch a $28 million Reg A+ sale cash offering for its STX tokens in July 2019. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/) — an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with actual BTC.\n\nCheck out [Bitcoin Cash (BCH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) — a forked of Bitcoin with several significant changes.\n\nLearn about side chains with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain).\n\nStay on top of the latest product updates, partnerships, and announcements with the CoinMarketCap [blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Stacks (STX) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAccording to the recently revamped economic policy launched with Stacks 2.0, the supply of the newly unlocked STX in circulation will be reduced by around 10% between now and 2020 compared to the original schedule. \n\nIn total, around 1.82 billion STX are expected to be in circulation by 2050, compared to around 739.7 million in circulation as of January 2021.\n\nAs per the [Stacks 2.0 whitepaper draft (v0.1)](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1AxyPunHHAHiEffXWESKfbvmBpGQv138Fp/stacks.pdf), a total of 1,000 STX per block will be released in the first four years, decreasing to 500 STX/block in the subsequent 4 years, 250 STX/block in the next four years, and then 120 STX/block after that in perpetuity.\n\nIn total, 6.6% of the initial genesis supply (1.32 billion STX) was allocated to the founder and a further 7.9% to the Stacks team. These are subject to a three year unlock schedule, with tokens next scheduled to unlock in November 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Stacks Network Secured?\n\nStacks uses the Bitcoin blockchain as its base layer. As a [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)-based blockchain, Bitcoin uses the combined efforts of thousands of miners and nodes to protect the network against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) by making it computationally and economically unfeasible to subvert the network. \n\nOn top of this, Stacks introduces its own consensus model, known as proof-of-transfer (PoX), which is a novel mining mechanism that sees users transfer the base currency (BTC) to mine STX — effectively bootstrapping the security of the Stacks blockchain using BTC. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Stacks (STX)?\n\nSTX is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and KuCoin. For a full list of available trading pairs and supported platforms, see the [markets section](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/markets/). \n\nFor more information about buying cryptocurrencies with fiat, click [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/). \n",stacks,,"arrington-xrp-capital, blockchain-capital-portfolio, dcg-portfolio, fabric-ventures-portfolio, hashkey-capital-portfolio, huobi-capital, usv-portfolio","Arrington XRP capital, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, DCG Portfolio, Fabric Ventures Portfolio, Hashkey Capital Portfolio, Huobi Capital, USV Portfolio",https://stacks.co,https://twitter.com/Stacks,"https://blog.blockstack.org/, https://forum.blockstack.org/","https://t.me/BlockstackChat, https://chat.blockstack.org/",https://explorer.stacks.co,https://reddit.com/r/stacks,https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1AxyPunHHAHiEffXWESKfbvmBpGQv138Fp/stacks.pdf,https://github.com/blockstack,,,2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,,True

5026,Orchid,orchid,OXT,active,token,"## What Is Orchid (OXT)?\n\nOrchid (OXT) is the native token of Orchid, a cryptocurrency-powered virtual private network (VPN).\n\nLaunched in December 2019, Orchid describes itself as the world’s first incentivized, peer-to-peer privacy network.\n\nIts aim is to overcome internet freedom limitations by using cryptocurrency payments to allow anyone to purchase bandwidth from any participating provider. This is done using so-called probabilistic nanopayments, which occur using OXT, an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard token on Ethereum.\n\nRegular payments to providers occur off-chain, allowing Orchid to avoid problems with congestion and [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network.\n\nThe service is pay-per-use, meaning that users only have to contribute funds when they actually connect, instead of paying monthly or annual fees.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Orchid?\n\nOrchid’s four co-founders come from the blockchain and financial spheres. They are Dr. Steven Waterhouse as CEO, Jay Freeman, Brian J. Fox and Gustav Simonsson.\n\nWaterhouse is a well-known figure within cryptocurrency, having also co-founded venture capital outfit Pantera Capital, which is responsible for investing in some of the industry’s most popular companies.\n\nFreeman is the creator of Cydia, an alternative Apple App Store for jailbroken Apple devices and currently used by around 30 million jailbroken Apple products.\n\nFox is responsible for the creation of United States bank Wells Fargo’s first interactive online banking system in the mid 1990s. \n\nSimonsson, meanwhile, is one of the Ethereum network’s core security developers, helping with its original launch in 2015. \n\nAccording to official literature, Waterhouse became alerted to the need for internet privacy improvements after becoming the victim of a [SIM-swap attack](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sim-swap), and began researching VPN technology.\n\n\n#### What Makes Orchid Unique?\n\nThe main idea behind Orchid is the use of blockchain technology to enhance the existing VPN experience. \n\nUsing cryptocurrency-based probabilistic nanopayments, users can benefit from anonymous VPN usage which does not rely on a centralized server and the risks associated with a particular country’s infrastructure.\n\nAs a freely-exchangeable ERC-20 token, OXT also provides a trading incentive to own and increase network value for owners. \n\nA separate feature allows users to purchase so-called “Orchid credits” with fiat currency. In this instance, OXT cannot be withdrawn and converted elsewhere, only spent with network providers. This is designed to appeal to those who do not wish to transact in cryptocurrency. \n\nThe appeal of Orchid, however, is not just among cryptocurrency users. Developers highlight a growing trend for internet freedom in the face of mounting geopolitical tensions and local restrictions. \n\nWeb 3.0 technology is used to provide some semblance of an open internet, as it was conceived when consumer access began to go mainstream in the early 1990s.\n\n\n##### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Mysterium [here](https://mysterium.network/).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency? Check out everything you need to know with CoinMarketCap’s educational resources [here](http://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\n\n#### How Many Orchid (OXT) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nOXT has a supply of 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) units. There is no inflation, but the possibility for deflation is maintained by possible token burns of OXT as part of regular network function.\n\nOf the total supply, 51.13% are earmarked for network incentives (held in the Orchid Treasury) and other purposes. 17.3% went to investors as part of the seed Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), 4.49% for SAFT 2a and 3.38% in SAFT 2b.\n\nThe remaining tokens will be distributed among four development teams. Multiple vesting schedules are in place, depending on the purpose and destination of the tokens.\n\n\n#### How Is the Orchid Network Secured?\n\nOXT is an ERC-20 standard token on Ethereum, and security risks revolve mainly around an attacker’s ability to harvest user data from Orchid itself.\n\nGiven that very little information is contained in the platform’s smart contracts used for payments, the weak links in the chain mostly lie with the user. As developers note, involving third parties in token purchases to use Orchid — for example, major exchanges — could ultimately lead to an attacker learning a user’s identity by tracing transactions to their exchange wallet.\n\n\n#### Where Can You Buy Orchid (OXT)?\n\nOXT is freely tradeable on major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase Pro, with cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat pairs available.\n\nTo learn more about how to purchase Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin)) and other cryptocurrencies, take a look [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to get acquainted with the options.""",orchid,,"polychain-capital-portfolio, blockchain-capital-portfolio, fabric-ventures-portfolio, kinetic-capital, a16z-portfolio","Polychain Capital Portfolio, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, Fabric Ventures Portfolio, Kinetic Capital, A16Z Portfolio",https://www.orchid.com/,https://twitter.com/OrchidProtocol,"https://blog.orchid.com/, https://www.reddit.com/r/orchid",https://www.t.me/OrchidOfficial,"https://etherscan.io/token/0x4575f41308EC1483f3d399aa9a2826d74Da13Deb, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4575f41308EC1483f3d399aa9a2826d74Da13Deb",https://reddit.com/r/orchid,https://www.orchid.com/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf,https://github.com/OrchidTechnologies/orchid,,1027,2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,,True

5113,inSure DeFi,insure,SURE,active,token,"**inSure DeFi** is a community-based crypto asset insurance ecosystem, where users can insure their crypto-portfolio by buying SURE tokens with fiat and other cryptocurrencies. inSure is designed to distribute crypto ownership risks amongst a liquidity pool, with insurance premiums determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model that leverages Chainlink. Capital required to back the risks at any point in time is based on the market pricing of SURE tokens, as well as community demand for insurance of crypto portfolios. A decentralized support system called the inSure DAO is also used to diligently process all the insurance claims, wherein voters make sure that any fraudulent claims are flagged and only valid claims are fulfilled.\n\n**inSure DeFi is a Decentralized Insurance Ecosystem**, trusted by thousands of community members to protect their crypto portfolios from scams, exchange closures, and drastic devaluations. inSure DeFi provides insurance solutions for the crypto space to stabilize and secure Crypto & DeFi portfolios.\n\n### Competitive Advantage of inSure\t\t\t\nA key factor in making a good insurance platform is the health of financial information, such as the usage of funds and whether there are sufficient premium floats to pay potential claims. Since the blockchain is a distributed ledger, each node has the same copy of the data. When the data changes, every insured person can see the synchronized and updated data, making the operation of each fund open and transparent. Therefore, there will be a dedicated module on the homepage of the website to disclose relevant information, and provide an accurate real-time financial status every quarter such as risk factors, minimum capital requirements, historical data on token prices, a summary of claims assessment, and the number of locked and traded tokens.\n\n### Economic Model - How it works\t\n\t\t\t\ninSure’s Crypto insurance is based on: \n\nI. **Dynamic Pricing Model**, to find the right market price via supply and demand; \n\nII. **Capital Model**, to secure the capital required to back the risks at any points of time; \n\nIII. **inSure DAO voting mechanism**, to make sure every claim is handled in a permissionless and transparent manner.\t\n\n### Capital Model\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInsurance is a highly leveraged industry; therefore, the primary concern of the insurance capital model is to calculate the capital required to guarantee the solvency of the risk pool to some arbitrary and high confidence level like 99.9% in the latest EIOPA’s Solvency II framework.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Capital Model is used to calculate the minimum capital the fund needs to hold, which is used to determine:\n\nI. The capital locked in the Capital Pool\n\nII. The staking power used in the Staking stage.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n### Surplus Pool\t\t\t\t\nThe surplus pool will accrue whenever an insurance premium is paid. 40% of the premium will be added into the surplus pool. Another 10% will be reserved till the expiration of the contract. If there is no claim, it will add into the surplus pool. The surplus pool will grow over time and will be utilized to cover insurance claims first. When the surplus pool cannot cover all the claims, the capital pool will be used to pay the rest. When the surplus pool grows large enough, the SURE holders will receive % from the staked SURE to better incentivise the increase of the inSure Staked Pool.\t\n\t\t\ninSure holders can stake on different DEXs and earn % from each trade in addition to the insurance that inSure plans provide. \t\n\t\t\t\nFor the first phase, we will focus on the risk against scams, devaluations and stolen funds. The more less-correlated business will be introduced to deliver higher returns to token holders at the community’s vote. \t\n\n### Governed by Community\t\t\t\t\nUnder normal circumstances, all operations on inSure can be completed by smart contracts. But in reality, in order to take into account the interests of users, better achieve decentralization effects, and ensure the process to be more transparent, decisions of certain events will require the community to vote. Therefore, the platform will set up an inSure DAO organization to facilitate such decisions and manage extreme situations. It should be noted that inSure DAO does not have the custody of the fund pool, nor can it release funds to any specific person. Each committee member may be replaced by voting at any time. \t\t\n\t\t\ninSure DAO will work in accordance with the two core principles of sustainability (that ensures the interests of community members by ensuring the sustainability of the overall funding pool) and growth (promoting sustainable premium increases and inSure DAO membership growth). The members of the inSure DAO organization include several people with specific expertise in insurance, co-governance, and blockchain development. Some powers that committee members have are: \n\n\nI. Reaching consensus to implement specific code that cannot be automatically deployed; \n\nII. Punishing bad actors within the inSure ecosystem (such as malicious claims, false claims, etc.) by burning SURE tokens. \n\nIII. The power to implement emergency suspension under special circumstances.\t\t\n\t\t\n**inSure DAO** members can negotiate and propose relevant proposals to the benefit of the inSure ecosystem. The voting proposals must include clear voting options and inSure DAO's recommendations. Then each community member is given a period of time to vote, and the result with a majority decision will be implemented. Any inSure holder can become a member of inSure DAO. \n\n### Future Integration for Automated Claim Processing of Stolen Funds and Scam Events using Google Cloud Platform (AutoML & Cloud Inference) \nIn addition to using Chainlink’s Historical Price Data, inSure DeFI is working on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain application combining Chainlink and Google Cloud AI. This allows inSure to process on-chain data related to insurable events (i.e.; stolen funds and scams) using Google AutoML, and then relay its outputs on-chain using Chainlink.\n\nChainlink’s ability to connect with any external API allows GET calls to retrieve the data/results from processing and deliver them directly to smart contracts. inSure DeFi will use this unique Chainlink feature to leverage Google Cloud Platform’s ML services (such as AutoML and Cloud Inference API) for processing publicly available information and data on the blockchain while feeding those decisions to the smart-contract via Chainlink oracles to trigger an automated fulfillment of insurance claims.\n\nAfter reviewing various oracle solutions, we elected to use Chainlink because of its time-tested security and flexibility to call any off-chain API. As the most widely-used oracle solution in the blockchain industry, Chainlink already secures over $10 billion dollars in on-chain value across DeFi, including leading projects like Aave, Synthetix, and more. Its network is backed by a large collection of secure node operators run by leading blockchain DevOps, which are aggregated into decentralized oracle networks to provide highly available, accurate, and tamperproof data feeds. Additionally, the historical price data being used by inSure consists of volume-adjusted global prices, aggregated from across all relevant CEXs and DEXs to ensure a high level of accuracy.\n\nBy combining its high-quality data and ability to connect to Big Data warehouses off-chain, inSure can build more robust and refined insurance products that cover various crypto portfolio risks.\n",insureteam,,"collectibles-nfts, defi, insurance, binance-smart-chain, polkadot-ecosystem","Collectibles & NFTs, DeFi, Insurance, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot Ecosystem",https://insuretoken.net/,https://twitter.com/InsureToken,,"https://t.me/insuretoken, https://t.me/insuresystem","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb5a4ac5b04e777230ba3381195eff6a60c3934f2, https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb5a4ac5b04e777230ba3381195eff6a60c3934f2, https://bscscan.com/token/0x4ac27c1b7eb76e28d1e24849c2da124790c00abc",https://reddit.com/r/insureteam,https://insuretoken.net/whitepaper.html,https://github.com/inSureToken/SmartContract/blob/master/inSure.sol,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5176277,1027,2020-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,,True

5444,Cartesi,cartesi,CTSI,active,token,"## What is Cartesi (CTSI)?\n[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io) is taking smart contracts to the next level. It is solving the urgent problem of scalability and high fees on blockchains by implementing a [variant of optimistic roll-ups](https://medium.com/cartesi/scalable-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-built-with-mainstream-software-stacks-8ad6f8f17997). Most notably, Cartesi is revolutionizing smart contract programming by allowing developers to code with mainstream software stacks. [Noether](https://cartesi.io/mine) is Cartesi's side-chain that’s optimized for ephemeral data, providing low-cost data availability to DApps.\n\n## CTSI Overview and Use Cases\n\n### CTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether.\n- Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network.\n- Node runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block.\n- Users of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain.\n\n### CTSI also plays a role with Descartes Rollups.\n- CTSI will be used by DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes.\n- Full details can be read on the [Cartesi Network and CTSI article](https://medium.com/cartesi/cartesi-network-and-ctsi-b9a5e206fedf).\n\n## What makes Cartesi Unique?\n\nWhat gives Cartesi a competitive edge as a layer-2 and optimistic rollups solution is that it allows developers to code their smart contracts and DApps directly with mainstream software components and Linux OS resources. That represents more than an incremental improvement to decentralized applications. It is a necessary step toward the maturity of the whole blockchain ecosystem. Allowing mainstream programmability means that DApp developers have an entirely new expressive power to create from simple to rather complex smart contracts. It also means opening the doors for extensive adoption of regular developers who have never programmed for blockchain, as they will create decentralized applications with a coding experience similar to desktop or web.\n\n### Key Highlights\n\n- Cartesi is a layer-2 infrastructure for blockchains that allows developers to code highly scalable smart contracts with mainstream software stacks on a Linux VM.

5566,Keep Network,keep-network,KEEP,active,token,"## What Is the Keep Network (KEEP)?\n\nKeep is an incentivized network for storing and encrypting private data on the public blockchain. The network is made of off-chain containers for private data known as keeps, while the KEEP work token enables it to be completely permissionless. Keep solves the main problem holding back blockchain adoption: that data on public blockchains are public. With Keep, developers can finally build fully decentralized apps. Visit [Keep](https://keep.network/) to learn more and stake, and [tBTC](https://tbtc.network/) to see its power in action.\n\ntBTC, a Bitcoin bridge on Ethereum, is the first application built on top of the Keep network. It is an open-source project supported by groups including Keep, Summa and the Cross-Chain Group. tBTC is a fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin. It facilitates Bitcoin holders acting on the Ethereum blockchain, accessing the DeFi ecosystem, and earning with their Bitcoin.\n\nKEEP is the network’s native work token with dividends and a slashing model. It provides the sybil resistance that allows the Keep network to be censorship resistant and permissionless.\n\nKEEP can be used to:\n\n* Secure the Keep Network and tBTC via staking\n* Run the random beacon and ECDSA nodes on the network \n* Run tBTC, similar to running a full node. KEEP stakers can play an even larger role as tBTC signers by bonding ETH. \n* Earn fees for providing work on the network \n\nKEEP applications and tools include: \n\n* Keep Random Beacon \n* tBTC - a decentralized Bitcoin bridge on Ethereum \n* [Keep Token Dashboard](https://dashboard.keep.network/) - an interface to manage and stake your KEEP\n* [Keep Stats](https://keepstats.org/) - high level summary of Keep and tBTC network stats \n* [All the Keeps](https://allthekeeps.com/deposits) - a tool to monitor all tBTC deposits on the Keep network \n\n## How Many KEEP Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe Keep Network launched its mainnet on April 27th, 2020 with 1 billion KEEP tokens created. KEEP tokens are a fixed supply asset, there will never be more than 1 billion KEEP in existence. \n\n### About the Keep Team\n\nThe Keep Network was founded in 2017 by Matt Luongo and Corbin Pon, crypto industry veterans who previously founded the Bitcoin rewards app Fold. \n\nThe Keep Network’s early supporting stakers include Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz, Draper Associates, Paradigm, Fenbushi, A.Capital, Collaborative Fund, and ParaFi among others. \n\nThe Keep project employs more than 20 staff, including engineers with deep experience in discrete mathematics and cryptography, and business leadership from ConsenSys’s founding days. \n\n#### What Makes Keep Unique?\n\nWhen it comes to dApps and DeFi projects...the team shouldn’t have the keys. The Keep Network features off-chain containers for private data called keeps that give smart contracts deep interactivity with private data without compromising transparency or auditability. \n\ntBTC, the first application built on the Keep Network, is censorship-resistant because it uses keeps to store data. Each TBTC token is fully backed and matched by at least 1 BTC held in reserve. tBTC is trustless, using Keep’s random beacon to select “signers” who are bonded in ETH and have responsibility for the deposited BTC. This means you can convert TBTC to BTC, and vice-versa, whenever you want, with no intermediary needed to sign off.  \n\n### Where Can I Get Keep (KEEP)?\n\nYou can earn KEEP by staking on the network today, and joining our ETH only stakedrop launching soon. You can also earn by participating in Playing for Keeps, which lets people learn to stake and win KEEP by contributing to the community. In order to qualify your submission for Playing for Keeps prizes, you must join our [Discord server](. Join the server to learn more about staking on the network today and participating in the public stakedrop soon. \n\nKEEP is also available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with cryptocurrency and [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pairs currently available.\n\n[Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap/) \n[Matcha](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/0x-protocol/) \n[Mooniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mooniswap/) \n[Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/)\n[Balancer](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/balancer/)\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

Its mainnet was launched in April 2020.\n\nThe platform has two native tokens. CELO is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) token used for transaction fees, governance participation and related activities. In future, the platform aims to host various stablecoins, with one, the Celo Dollar (CUSD), already in use.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Celo?\n\nCelo was originally founded by a team comprised of people from MIT, Stanford, Google, Square, Circle, Visa, GoDaddy, World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Cambridge University, U.S. Department of Justice, Bank Of America, Capital One, Twitter, Give Directly, and the Gates Foundation\n\nSeparate entities are aimed at Celo’s promotion and preservation. The dedicated Celo Foundation is a non-profit which launched along with the mainnet, while the Celo Alliance for Prosperity is what the company describes as an “ecosystem of mission-aligned organizations.”\n\n\n#### What Makes Celo Unique?\n\nCelo’s main unique selling point lies in its focus on smartphone users. The company argues that the number of smartphone owners is increasing exponentially, but the number of people using cryptocurrency is rising at a much slower pace.\n\nCryptocurrency is further highly suited to regions in which a large section of the population does not have access to the banking sector, but still has a smartphone.\n\nBridging the gap between the two technologies is what Celo aims to do, along with harnessing the benefits of DeFi by supporting the creation of DApps and smart contracts.\n\nOptimized for mobile, the Celo blockchain automatically calculates transaction fees, and also allows users to pay the [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) which power transactions in any currency.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about Facebook Libra [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/facebook-libra/).\n\nCrypto newbie?

5617,UMA,uma,UMA,active,token,"## What Is UMA [UMA]?\n\nUMA, or Universal Market Access, is a protocol for the creation of synthetic assets based on the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain. UMA was launched in December 2018.\n\nSynthetic assets are a class of assets that represent different, underlying assets and have the same value. UMA specifically enables its users to design and create self-executing, self-enforcing financial contracts secured by economic incentives and run them on Ethereum’s blockchain.\n\nIn essence, UMA allows counterparties to digitize and automate any real-world financial derivatives, such as futures, contracts for differences (CFDs) or total return swaps. It also enables the creation of self-fulfilling derivative contracts based on digital assets, like other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of UMA?\n\nUMA was co-founded by Hart Lambur and Allison Lu, who met on the Goldman Sachs trading floor.\n\nIn 2005, Lambur graduated from Columbia University with a computer science degree. In addition to co-founding UMA, he is also the CEO and co-founder of Risk Labs, the company in charge of developing the Universal Market Access protocol.\n\nPrior to UMA and Risk Labs, Lambur worked as a research assistant at Columbia and as a government bond trader at Goldman Sachs. He has also founded and headed Openfolio, a personal finance tracking platform which he sold to Stone Ridge Asset Management in 2017.\n\nAllison Lu has received a degree in Economics and Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2015, she worked as a vice president at Goldman Sachs, where Lu and Lambur met. Afterward, Lu worked as the VP of credit & risk analysis at the financial services mobile app Tala. She was also an advisor at One Daijo, an Ethereum-based peer-to-peer lending platform.\n\n\n#### What Makes UMA Unique?\n\nThe main idea behind Universal Market Access is reflected in its name: by developing a protocol for the creation of synthetic assets and financial contracts on the blockchain, it seeks to democratize and decentralize the financial derivatives market.\n\nThe traditional financial markets have high barriers to entry in the form of regulations and custody requirements, which tend to preclude individuals from participating in them. It is often especially difficult for would-be traders and investors to take part in markets outside of their local financial system. This prevents the emergence of a truly inclusive global financial market and limits participation to a handful of institutions that can afford the necessary due diligence and legal procedures.\n\nUMA contracts, on the other hand, are based on Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), whose permissionless nature allows any user to create, run and trade digitized derivatives from anywhere in the world. This accessibility is especially important for the developing economies around the globe, where financial institutions are frequently far from maturity, forcing local market participants into relative isolation.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLooking for more projects that aim to disrupt the industry of finance? See our [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/) page.\n\nAccess more info about [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), the platform UMA is based on.\n\n\n#### How Many UMA [UMA] Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nUMA is the governance token of the Universal Market Access protocol, meaning that its holders have the right to vote on changes to the protocol’s parameters and system upgrades.\n\nThe total supply of UMA is a little over 100 million tokens, of which about 55 million are in circulation as of October 2020.\n\nFrom the total supply, 2 million tokens were sold during the project’s initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)), 48.5 million were reserved for the founders of the project, 35 million were put aside as rewards for the developers of the protocol and 14.5 million designated for future sales.\n\nIn order to incentivize voter participation, every time a voting process takes place on the network, an inflationary reward equal to 0.05% of the current UMA supply is distributed among active voters proportionate to their current stake.\n\n\n### How Is the UMA Network Secured?\n\nUMA runs on top of Ethereum’s blockchain and as a consequence, they are protected by the same [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) hash function Ethash.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy UMA [UMA]?\n\nUMA can be bought at multiple major cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the largest of which are:\n\n\n\n*   [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/)\n*   [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)",,,"defi, derivatives, oracles, dao, coinbase-ventures-portfolio, governance, synthetics, blockchain-capital-portfolio, dragonfly-capital-portfolio, placeholder-ventures-portfolio","DeFi, Derivatives, Oracles, DAO, Coinbase Ventures Portfolio, Governance, Synthetics, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, DragonFly Capital Portfolio, Placeholder Ventures Portfolio",https://umaproject.org/,https://twitter.com/UMAprotocol,https://medium.com/uma-project,https://join.slack.com/t/umaprotocol/shared_invite/enQtNTk4MjQ4ODY0MDA1LTM4ODg0NGZhYWZkNjkzMDE4MjU0ZGFlYWQzZTFiZWFlZjI2NDE4OGI2NWY3OTdhYjYyZjg0MjAzMTgwODVhZTE,"https://etherscan.io/token/0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828",,,https://github.com/UMAprotocol,,1027,2020-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,,True

5632,Arweave,arweave,AR,active,coin,"## What Is Arweave (AR)?\n\nArweave is a decentralized [storage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/storage-decentralized) network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. [Describing](https://www.arweave.org/#arweave-intro) itself as ""a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,"" the network primarily hosts ""the permaweb"" — a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms.\n\nThe Arweave network uses a native [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), AR, to pay ""miners"" to indefinitely store the network's information.\n\nThe project was first [announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2066098) as Archain in August 2017, later [rebranding](https://arweave.medium.com/archain-now-known-as-arweave-432f0708eed0) to Arweave in February 2018 and officially [launching](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-network-launch-report-b7e7ffac0f75) in June 2018.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Arweave?\n\nArweave was founded by Sam Williams and William Jones, two Ph.D. candidates at the University of Kent. Williams came to the project with experience in decentralized and distributed systems, having developed an operating system called HydrOS as a part of his studies, while Jones' focus was on graph theory and neural networking. While Williams dropped out of graduate school to focus on the company, Jones left the project early on in mid-2018 and completed his Ph.D.\n\nAccording to Williams, he came up with the idea while [walking](https://cryptosrus.com/interview-with-ceo-sam-williams-and-cto-will-jones-of-archain/) up a mountain in Scotland, later bringing the concept to Jones, with whom he developed the technical details. After launching Arweave, Williams was later named an advisor to Minespider, a company providing [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based supply chain tracking for the raw materials industry, and he has served as a mentor for the Techstars accelerator program.\n\nAlthough Arweave was founded with centralized leadership, it [launched](https://arweave.medium.com/the-arca-dao-is-launched-71d59fd79f7) a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) in January 2020 comprised of core community members to further the development and expansion of the network and its ecosystem.\n\n\n#### What Makes Arweave Unique?\n\nAccording to its yellow paper, Arweave [seeks](https://www.arweave.org/yellow-paper.pdf) to ensure the ""collective ability to store and share information between individuals and across time to new generations."" In order to accomplish this goal, its flagship permaweb is built on top of Arweave's ""blockweave,"" a variation of blockchain technology in which each block is linked to both the one immediately prior and also a random earlier one. Arweave says this incentivizes miners to store more data because they need to be able to access random previous blocks to add new ones and receive rewards.\n\nArweave is focused on building a sustainable ecosystem around the network.

The company [allocated](https://icoanalytics.medium.com/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%80-ico-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B0-arweave-5f4a1a42d333) an additional 19.5% for a private sale, 2.9% for project advisors, 13% for the team (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year), 19.1% for ecosystem development, and 26.5% for future project use (subject to a five-year lock-up with 20% released per year).\n\n\n### How Is the Arweave Network Secured?\n\nThe Arweave network is built on a modified version of blockchain technology it calls ""blockweave,"" which uses a ""proof-of-access"" [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm — a modified version of [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake). With PoA, each new block is not only linked to the one immediately prior to it but to a random previous block as well, and both blocks are hashed to generate the new one. Miners are not required to store an entire blockchain, but they are incentivized to store more information to prove they can access the old blocks that are required to mine a new one.\n\nThe mining protocol used by Arweave, RandomX, was successfully [audited](https://ostif.org/four-audits-of-randomx-for-monero-and-arweave-have-been-completed-results/) by four cybersecurity firms — Trail of Bits, Kudelski Security, X41 D-Sec and QuarksLab — in August 2019. The project plans to utilize a new mining algorithm starting in early 2021 known as SPoRA, which it [said](https://twitter.com/ArweaveTeam/status/1338600305643167745) in December 2020 had been audited by NCC Group.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Arweave (AR)?\n\nAR can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), and [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/), among others.

5692,Compound,compound,COMP,active,token,"## What Is Compound (COMP)?\n\nCompound is a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into one of several pools supported by the platform. \n\nWhen a user deposits tokens to a Compound pool, they receive cTokens in return. These cTokens represent the individual’s stake in the pool and can be used to redeem the underlying cryptocurrency initially deposited into the pool at any time. For example, by depositing ETH into a pool, you will receive cETH in return. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens to the underlying asset increases, which means you can redeem them for more of the underlying asset than you initially put in — this is how the interest is distributed. \n\nOn the flip side, borrowers can take a secured loan from any Compound pool by depositing collateral. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio varies based on the collateral asset, but currently ranges from 50 to 75%. The interest rate paid varies by borrowed asset and borrowers can face automatic liquidation if their collateral falls below a specific maintenance threshold.\n\nSince the launch of the Compound mainnet in September 2018, the platform has skyrocketed in popularity, and recently passed more than $800 million in total locked value. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Compound?\n\nCompound was founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, both of whom previously worked in high-profile roles at Postmates — an online food delivery service. The two continue to hold executive positions at Compound Labs, Inc — the software development firm behind the Compound protocol, with Leshner currently serving as CEO, while Hayes is the CTO.\n\nThough both founders have experience founding successful companies, Robert Leshner, in particular, has been particularly active in helping to grow the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) space, and has publicly invested in popular crypto platforms including Argent Wallet, Opyn, and Blockfolio. \n\nThe Compound team now comprises over a dozen individuals — almost half of which work as engineers.\n\n\n### What Makes Compound Unique?\n\nAccording to Compound, the majority of cryptocurrencies sit idle on exchange platforms, doing nothing for their holders. Compound looks to change this with its open lending platform, which allows anybody who deposits supported Ethereum tokens to easily earn interest on their balance or take out a secured loan — all in a completely trustless way. \n\nCompound’s community governance sets it apart from other similar protocols. Holders of the platform’s native governance token — COMP — can propose changes to the protocol, debate and vote whether to implement changes suggested by others — without any involvement from the Compound team. This can include choosing which cryptocurrencies to add support for, adjusting collateralization factors, and making changes to how COMP tokens are distributed.\n\nThese COMP tokens can be bought from third-party exchanges or can be earned by interacting with the Compound protocol, such as by depositing assets or taking out a loan. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn about [Aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) — one of Compound's biggest competitors.\n\nRead about [yearn.finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/) — one of the first yield farming protocols.\n\nWant to brush up on your crypto knowledge? Check out [CMC Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\nRead our [blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) to stay up to date with the latest industry news and events.\n\n\n#### How Many Compound (COMP) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nLike many digital assets, only a fixed number of COMP tokens will ever come into existence. The total supply is capped at 10 million COMP and as of writing, less than a third are in circulation (~3.3 million). \n\nOut of these 10 million tokens, just over 4.2 million tokens will be distributed to Compound users over a 4-year period. The second biggest allotment (almost 2.4 million COMP) goes to the Compound Labs, Inc shareholders, whereas 2.2 million tokens will be distributed to the Compound founders and current team with a 4 year vesting schedule. \n\nFinally, 775,000 COMP are reserved for community governance incentives and the remaining 332,000 tokens will be allocated to future team members. \n\nThe exact rate of COMP emission is subject to change over time, as voters are able to increase or reduce the emission rate by passing a proposal through [community governance](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-decentralized-b18659f811e0). \n\n\n### How Is the Compound Network Secured?\n\nEverything on Compound is handled automatically by [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), which act to mint cTokens after [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) assets are deposited, and allow Compound users to redeem their stake using their cTokens. \n\nThe protocol enforces a collateralization factor for all assets supported by the platform, ensuring each pool is overcollateralized at all times. If the collateral falls below the minimum maintenance level, it will be sold to liquidators at a 5% discount, paying down some of the loan and returning the remainder to an acceptable collateralization factor. \n\nThis arrangement helps to ensure borrowers maintain their collateral levels, provides a safety net for lenders, and creates an earning opportunity for liquidators. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Compound (COMP)?\n\nCOMP is currently available to trade on hundreds of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/).

The platform’s native token, AVAX, performs various tasks within Avalanche and also functions as a rewards and payment system for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Avalanche?\r\n\r\nAva Labs has three co-founders, among whom is [Emin Gün Sirer](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/02/28/professor-emin-gun-sirer-the-crypto-revolution-is-here-to-stay/), the veteran computer scientist long associated with Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) and decentralized networks.\r\n\r\nSirer has long been concerned with Bitcoin scaling, and the Avalanche Consensus is a direct follow-on from this research, allowing transaction volumes significantly higher than Bitcoin and competing with the likes of Visa.\r\n\r\nLike Sirer, fellow co-founders Kevin Sekniqi and Maofan “Ted” Yin are also associated with Cornell University. Sirer is an advisor to Yin, who is undertaking a PhD in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the team is made up of computer science, economics, finance and law experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What Makes Avalanche Unique?\r\n\r\nAvalanche provides decentralized asset trading which anyone can launch and use, and does so with a network which is unique in the digital realm in providing subsecond transaction confirmations.\r\n\r\nDevelopers aim to bring together the huge, fragmented and often opaque world of asset trading under one roof, allowing barrier-free access. Developers can create and release all manner of entities from blockchains to digital representations of any asset, and allow them to trade according to any given parameters. These include, for example, mimicking compliance regulations in various jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nThe AVAX token forms the in-house payment method for Avalanche, and is used for fee collection during transactions, as well as for incentives and related purposes. Users can also earn passive income by staking their coins on the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### **Related Pages**:\r\n\r\nCheck out CMC Alexandria’s deep dive into Avalanche [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-avalanche).\r\n\r\nRead more about Ethereum 2.0 [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/what-is-ethereum-2-0-why-is-it-important/).\r\n\r\nCheck out our interview with Emin Gün Sirer [here](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/02/28/professor-emin-gun-sirer-the-crypto-revolution-is-here-to-stay/).\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies? Check out CoinMarketCap’s dedicated guide [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Many Avalanche (AVAX) Coins Are There In Circulation?\r\n\r\nAVAX has a maximum capped supply of 720,000,000 (720 million) tokens. The genesis block contained half of that supply.\r\n\r\nThe other half will be released according to an emission curve detailed in the Avalanche whitepaper. A key difference to the emission of Bitcoin — which is unalterable — is that the AVAX release rate can be changed by community consensus. The supply cannot be changed; all that can differ from consensus is the rate at which the supply cap is reached.\r\n\r\nIn another contrast to Bitcoin and many other networks, transaction fees are “burnt” in order to increase token scarcity. This process is offset by the release, or “minting,” of new coins.\r\n\r\nTransaction fees themselves vary according to the type of operation that the AVAX transaction is performing on the Avalanche network. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Is the Avalanche Network Secured?\r\n\r\nAvalanche is a proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) protocol which rewards users for staking coins. PoS networks have come under fire for their low attack cost, which in some cases has exposed serious vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ava Labs, Avalanche gets around this by changing governance to make it all but impossible for an attacker to covertly gain the necessary consensus.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Where Can You Buy Avalanche (AVAX)?\r\n\r\nAVAX is a freely-exchangeable token and has made its way to major exchanges including Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global.\r\n\r\nIf you’re new to cryptocurrency, you can read more about how to buy Bitcoin or any other token [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\r\n""",Avax,,"defi, polychain-capital-portfolio, avalanche-ecosystem, cms-holdings-portfolio, dragonfly-capital-portfolio","DeFi, Polychain Capital Portfolio, Avalanche Ecosystem, CMS Holdings Portfolio, DragonFly Capital Portfolio","https://www.avalabs.org/, https://info.avax.network/#about",https://twitter.com/AvalancheAVAX,,"https://t.me/avalancheavax, https://chat.avalabs.org/","https://avascan.info/, https://explorer.avax.network/",https://reddit.com/r/Avax,https://files.avalabs.org/papers/consensus.pdf,https://github.com/ava-labs,,,2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,2020-09-22T00:39:00.000Z,True

He’s also the CEO of Fusion, a blockchain interoperability solution, and co-founded WeDeFi and QTUM. \n\nQian began his journey in the industry in 2013. He began his work in this field by developing [ASIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic) chips for Bitcoin mining. As a result, Qian was the first person to build a mining farm in China. \n\nIn late 2017, Qian launched the Fusion white paper, which explored and brought cryptofinance into focus. Those efforts could be considered as one of the very early steps in developing what is more commonly known as DeFi, which stands for decentralized finance. \n\nAnyswap was also co-founded by Zhao Jun. He also serves as the acting CEO of Anyswap. \n\n\n#### What Makes Anyswap Unique?\n\nAnyswap is powered by Fusion. The Fusion Network uses a process known as private key sharding — where the private key is split up into several bits and managed by various network nodes — to guarantee assets are safe. \n\nThe different parts of the private key are never combined during transfers or trading to boost security.\n\nSmart contracts on Anyswap are open source, a factor which enhances security using individual audits. \n\nThe open-source nature of Anyswap is important because it makes it easier to verify whether a platform is decentralized. One of the most important features of Anyswap is that the token paves the way for users to exchange cryptocurrencies with immediate effect. \n\nThe ANY token also enables holders the freedom to determine which coins are most appropriately suited to be listed on the Anyswap DEX, its decentralized exchange. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[What is the role of private keys in crypto?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/private-keys-the-keys-to-your-crypto)\n\nCheck out our [deep dive into decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nLearn about cryptocurrencies with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\n \\\nSubscribe to the [CoinMarketCap newsletter](https://coinmarketcap.com/newsletter).\n\n\n#### How Many Anyswap (ANY) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nWhen it comes to the maximum supply possible, Anyswap’s supply cannot exceed 100 million. It has a circulating supply of roughly more than 17 million. The initial supply of ANY was 15 million, including 5 million in initial liquidity provision upon the launch of the platform. The remaining 10 million was earmarked for the community and ecosystem to increase Anyswap’s user base, among other things. \n\n\n#### How is the Anyswap Network Secured?\n\nAnyswap will support all ERC-20 tokens, meaning it is based on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Anyswap (ANY)?\n\nThere are several exchanges which enable purchases of Anyswap. These include Hotbit, [1inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/1inch-exchange/) and [SushiSwap](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).

5957,DFI.Money,yearn-finance-ii,YFII,active,token,"## What Is DFI.MONEY (YFII)?\n\nDFI.MONEY, also known as YFII, is a fork of popular decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) aggregator platform yearn.finance ([YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)).\n\nLaunched in July 2020, it aims to optimize returns for DeFi investors while adhering to changes proposed in an upgrade plan called YIP-8.\n\nIn addition to protocol changes, DFI.MONEY has also released new products, chief among which, the Vault, it describes as its “killer product.”\n\nThe native token of DFI.MONEY is YFII, a fixed-supply token which liquidity providers earn in accordance with their network interaction.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of DFI.MONEY?\n\nDFI.MONEY originated as a hard fork of yearn.finance, the aggregator for DeFi returns created by Andre Cronje. \n\nCronje left the original incarnation of yearn.finance, iEarn, in early 2020, only to return to continue its development, whereupon its popularity grew considerably as DeFi became more mainstream.\n\nIn July 2020, mining and farming of yearn.finance’s YFI token ended, and a proposal to protect liquidity provision from whales earned 80% support among protocol participants. However, it was not adopted due to not meeting yearn.finance’s requisite 33% quorum requirement.\n\nAs a result, a group of users opted to hard fork the protocol to create DFI.MONEY, with its own token, YFII.\n\nThe hard fork implemented the proposal, known as YIP-8, which makes YFII rewards decrease each week, following a pattern popularized by [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC).\n\n\n#### What Makes DFI.MONEY Unique?\n\nDFI.MONEY essentially fulfils the same role in the DeFi marketplace as yearn.finance, subject to different protocol rules for its token and with some new features.\n\nIts appeal is thus aimed at users of its predecessor who voted in favor of YIP-8, as well as newcomer DeFi investors who want to maximize returns by providing liquidity.\n\nDFI.MONEY’s website states that its protocol is community-owned and does not offer commercial incentives such as developer rewards by default.\n\nUsers join one or both of two liquidity pools which feature [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/) (CFI) or [Balancer](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) (BAL), earning YFII tokens as a reward for providing liquidity. \n\nDFI.MONEY also introduced a new feature, the Vault, which seeks to gain users the highest returns of any token automatically according to user-submitted strategies, without the users themselves manually setting up transactions. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about yearn.finance [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/).\n\nRead more about Harvest Finance [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/).\n\nNew to crypto? Find the answers to all your questions with [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics), CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.\n\n\n#### How Many DFI.MONEY (YFII) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nYFII is an ERC-20 standard token with a fixed supply of 40,000 YFII. According to the characteristics set out and accepted in YIP-8, no premine, presale or developer-allocated tokens were taken from the total supply.\n\nDFI.MONEY states that the only way of earning YFII is by providing liquidity to the protocol. Tokens are distributed according to liquidity provision, with rewards decreasing weekly. Each of the two liquidity pools began with a supply of 20,000 YFII.\n\nA schedule confirms that token distribution was completed 10 weeks after it began, at the end of September 2020.\n\n\n### How Is the DFI.MONEY Network Secured?\n\nDFI.MONEY states that YFII has a guaranteed fixed supply of 40,000 tokens which cannot be manipulated by developers.\n\nThis was made possible by sending keys allowing minting of new tokens to a so-called “blackhole” address, and access to them is permanently lost.\n\nDevelopers published links to the transactions showing transfer of the keys to the blackhole.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy DFI.MONEY (YFII)?\n\nYFII has become a popular trading token since its launch. As of October 2020, it is available on multiple major exchanges, with trading pairs featuring cryptocurrencies, [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) and other DeFi tokens.\n\n[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) are among the exchanges with the largest YFII volume.\n\nStill a crypto newbie?

5964,Trust Wallet Token,trust-wallet-token,TWT,active,token,"## What Is Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?\n\nTrust Wallet Token, or TWT, is a simple BEP-20 utility token that provides a range of benefits and incentives to Trust Wallet users. Trust Wallet itself is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that supports dozens of popular native assets, in addition to popular tokens on the Ethereum, Binance and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) blockchains.\n\nHolders of TWT tokens unlock a variety of benefits when using Trust Wallet, including discounts on in-app cryptocurrency purchases and on the use of decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) services. TWT holders can also participate in the governance of Trust Wallet and can vote on Trust Wallet update proposals, helping to shape the development of the app. \n\nTrust Wallet Token was initially launched as a BEP-2 asset on Binance Chain, but was relaunched as a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain in October 2020.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Trust Wallet Token\n\nTrust Wallet was founded by Viktor Radchenko in 2017. Based in Mountain View, California, Radchenko previously held development and engineering roles at several tech firms, and also co-founded Trucker Path in 2013 — the company behind one of the most popular apps for truckers and logistics firms. \n\nRadchenko turned his attention to the mobile cryptocurrency wallet industry when he found that “app stores did not have any open source wallets for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC20 tokens.”\n\nThe platform was acquired by [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in July 2018 for an undisclosed sum, but Radchenko still works on the platform as part of the Binance team. The full [Trust Wallet team](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2218440709%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH) is not public, but it is known to comprise over 20 individuals — many of which have overlapping roles at Binance. \n\n\n## What Makes Trust Wallet Token Unique?\n\nTrust Wallet Token is a utility token designed to provide additional value to users of the Trust Wallet mobile app — it doesn’t have any utility outside of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. \n\nDespite this, as a BEP-20 asset, Trust Wallet Tokens can be transferred to any wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain assets, where it may be exchanged against other assets or used as payment for services. Since it also confers voting rights and governance over the development of Trust Wallet and can be used for discounted DEX trades and in-app purchases, TWT has gone on to develop value of its own as a speculative instrument. \n\nTWT was also one of the first tokens to launch on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) — a high-performance [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). As a result, TWT can be transferred with extremely low fees and near-instant transaction confirmation times. \n\n\n### Relevant Pages\n\n[Binance Coin (BNB) ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/)is the cryptocurrency that powers the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nRead about [Crypto.com Coin (CRO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com-coin/).\n\nLearn how to use a Bitcoin Wallet with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet).\n\nStay on top of the market with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n## How Many Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs part of the transition to Binance Smart Chain, 99% of the original TWT token supply was burned and the new maximum supply was set at 1 billion TWT — of this, just over a quarter is currently in circulation. \n\nThe circulating supply of TWT will gradually grow as TWT tokens are earned by Trust Wallet users for completing various tasks, such as by participating in referral campaigns, taking quizzes and completing tasks within the app — like cryptocurrency [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and trading.\n\nAs per the [official source](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-token-twt-listed-on-binance-dex/62145), 40% of the TWT token supply will be targeted towards user acquisition, 15% will be distributed to the Trust Wallet community, 30% will be held in reserve and 15% is allocated to developers. As of October 2020, Trust Wallet has not yet published the full tokenomics or emission schedule for the Trust Wallet Token. \n\n\n## How Is the Trust Wallet Token Network Secured?\n\nBased on Binance Smart Chain, the Trust Wallet Token is backed by a rigorously tested [proof-of-stake (POS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism. This is used to protect the network against a range of potential threats, including [51%](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and Sybil attacks. \n\nIt’s also protected by a generous bug bounty program operated by Binance, which pays up to $10,000 in BNB to anybody that discovers a vulnerability on Binance Chain and its core smart contracts. \n\nBeyond this, as a BEP-20 asset, TWT is secured by the security of the wallet software used to manage it. For Trust Wallet, this includes a passcode security lock and a 12-word recovery phrase. \n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?\n\nTrust Wallet Token is available to purchase and trade on a variety of platforms — including both centralized and decentralized exchanges. [MXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/) and [Binance DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-dex/) are among the most liquid exchanges for TWT. The token is currently tradable against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nLooking to buy cryptocurrencies like Trust Wallet Token with fiat?

In return, it collects swap, lending and borrowing fees from users. \n\nThe platform aims to list and support tokens important to the DeFi sector, for example the biggest stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, yCRV, etc), governance tokens (COMP, BAL, YFI, LEND, CRV, CREAM etc.), and other leading cryptocurrencies such as ETH, [renBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bringing-bitcoin-to-defi-a-complete-beginners-deep-dive-into-renvm) and [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/). \n\nAs an ERC20 token on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network, CREAM can run Ethereum Virtual Machines through smart contracts, while users can create DAoos for its community, thus resulting in better composability, i.e. plugging different financial services into each other. \n\nCREAM tokens can be staked for a period of up to four years in order to accrue rewards; however, it is important to note that there is no admin unlock available.Therefore, you will only receive your rewards at the end of your staking period.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Compound Finance (COMP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/).\n\nLearn more about [Curve DAO (CRV).](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/) \n\nLearn more about [yearn.finance (YFI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/).\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for the latest blockchain news and insights.  \\\n\n\n\n#### How Many C.R.E.A.M. Finance (CREAM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nCREAM has a total supply of 9 million coins, of which around around 150,000 are currently in circulation. This will increase as more vested tokens are released monthly to stakeholders and liquidity miners. \n\n\n### How Is the C.R.E.A.M. Network Secured?\n\nCREAM’s smart contracts are not officially audited at present by choice. Instead, Huang uses expert advisers (which includes Compound founder Robert Leshner) to improve security, inspect code and manage a multisig wallet to keep users funds safe. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy C.R.E.A.M. Finance (CREAM)?\n\nThe top exchanges for trading in Cream Finance are currently [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Binance.KR](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-kr/), [FTX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ftx/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/) and [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/).

6210,The Sandbox,the-sandbox,SAND,active,token,"## What Is The Sandbox (SAND)?\n\nLaunched in 2011 by Pixowl, The Sandbox is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.\n\nAccording to the [official whitepaper](https://installers.sandbox.game/The_Sandbox_Whitepaper_2020.pdf), the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming successfully. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of The Sandbox?\n\n[Arthur Madrid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurmadrid/) is co-founder and CEO at Pixowl, and he is one of the driving forces behind The Sandbox. He graduated with a degree in economics from Université Paris Dauphine in 2000. Madrid’s professional career began as a consultant for Eurogroup Consulting France, but he soon found his entrepreneurial spirit. In 2001, he founded 1-Click Media, which was later purchased by Ipercast. \n\n[Sebastien Borget](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borgetsebastien/) is also a co-founder at Pixowl and serves as the COO of the company. He graduated with a degree in computer systems networking and telecommunications from Institut national des Télécommunications in 2007. His professional career began as a project lead for 1-Click Media, and since then, Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget have been an entrepreneurial duo. They founded Pixowl in 2011 and have been continually working on projects together.\n\n\n#### What Makes The Sandbox Unique?\n\nThe Sandbox is a unique platform because it introduces blockchain technology to the world of gaming. The gaming industry is a huge untapped market when it comes to the adoption of blockchain tech, and Pixowl saw that in 2011. By creating a universe where gamers can create and collect blockchain-based assets, the Sandbox aims to revolutionizes the market. It makes a niche for itself in the global market of gaming. \n\nBy focusing on user-generated content, the Sandbox creates a metaverse of involved players who contribute to the platform’s further development. Not only that, by introducing the SAND token, the Sandbox promotes decentralized governance and allows users to share their views and ideas about the development of the project. Thanks to the evolving technology, decentralized governance is becoming a must-have in blockchain-based projects.\n\nThe company started out with a bang and attracted support and investments from numerous big names in the gaming industry. These include brands like Atari, Helix and CryptoKitties. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Enjin Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/).\n\nFind out more about [Decentraland](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/).\n\nLearn more about [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-access-dapps-on-your-mobile-phone).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many The Sandbox (SAND) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThere is a maximum and total supply of 3,000,000,000 SAND tokens. Currently, about 680,266,194 SAND tokens are in active circulation, which represents 23% of the total supply available as of March 2021.\n\nOf the total token supply, about 25.82% was set aside in a company reserve. Another 17.18% were allocated for the seed sale of the token. The founders and team members secured about 31% of the total token supply distributed among them. Around 12% of the total supply were set aside for a dedicated Binance Launchpad Sale, and another 10% were dedicated as rewards to advisors on the project. \n\n\n### How Is The Sandbox Network Secured?\n\nAs the Sandbox virtual world is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it is secured by the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. The SAND token is a standard version [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, which means owners can stake it and benefit from staking rewards. \n\nUnlike the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus mechanism employed by the Bitcoin blockchain, PoS does not require vast amounts of electrical or computing power to validate transactions. It relies on stakeholders with the largest holdings in SAND tokens. The PoS consensus mechanism allows for a lot of diverse applications while still ensuring the security of staked funds. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy The Sandbox (SAND)?\n\nThe Sandbox is enjoying a rise in interest from both investors and users, and more exchanges have started offering trades with the SAND token. [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) has the largest trading volume of SAND/BUSD, with $7,015,941 processed in transactions so far as of March 2021.\n\nOther options for buying SAND include [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/), and [LATOKEN](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/latoken/).\n\n[Find more information](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying cryptos.\n",,,"collectibles-nfts, content-creation, gaming, ethereum, binance-launchpad, metaverse","Collectibles & NFTs, Content Creation, Gaming, Ethereum, Binance Launchpad, Metaverse",https://www.sandbox.game/en/,https://twitter.com/thesandboxgame,https://medium.com/sandbox-game,"https://discord.gg/vAe4zvY, https://t.me/sandboxgame","https://etherscan.io/token/0x3845badAde8e6dFF049820680d1F14bD3903a5d0, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3845badAde8e6dFF049820680d1F14bD3903a5d0",,http://www.sandbox.game/The_Sandbox_Whitepaper_2020.pdf,,,1027,2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,,True

6636,Polkadot,polkadot-new,DOT,active,coin,"## What Is Polkadot (DOT)?\n\nPolkadot is an [open-source sharding multichain protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot) that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range of blockchains interoperable with each other. \n\nThis interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web, controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. \n\nThe Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained further down). \n\nPolkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding.\n\nPolkadot has four core components:\n\n\n\n*   Relay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; \n*   Parachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases;\n*   Parathread: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model; \n*   Bridges: allows parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Polkadot?\n\nPolkadot was founded by the Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web, as an open-source project. \n\nIts founders are Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban. \n\nWood, the Web3 Foundation’s president, is the most well-known of the trio thanks to his industry influence as Ethereum co-founder, Parity Technologies founder and the creator of the smart contract coding language Solidity. \n\nHabermeier is a Thiel Fellow and accomplished blockchain and cryptography researcher and developer. Czaban is the Web3 Foundation’s Technology Director. With a wealth of experience across highly specialized fintech industries, he is currently helping to develop a new generation of distributed technology. \n\n\n### What Makes Polkadot Unique?\n\nPolkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (“parachains”). This parallel processing power improves scalability. \n\nCustom blockchains are quick and easy to develop through the Substrate framework and can be connected to Polkadot’s network within minutes. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants similar to apps on a smartphone. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs. \n\nThe network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system that also helps to secure it. Communities can customize their blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, collators and fishermen all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Cosmos (ATOM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn more about [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span> \n\nLearn more about [Cardano (ADA)..](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/)\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for trending blockchain news and insights. \n\n\n#### How Many Polkadot (DOT) Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nPolkadot currently has an allocation of 1 billion DOT tokens, following the [network’s redenomination](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/redenomination) from an initial maximum supply of 10 million in August 2020. The redenomination was undertaken purely to avoid the use of small decimals and make calculation easier. While all balances were increased by a factor of one hundred, this did not impact the distribution of DOT or holders’ proportional share. \n\n\n### How Is the Polkadot Network Secured?\n\nPolkadot’s mass interoperability through a set of common validators helps to secure its multiple blockchains and allows them to scale their transactions by spreading their data across many parachains.  \n\nThe network uses the NPoS (nominated proof-of-stake) mechanism to select validators and nominators and maximize chain security. \n\nThis unique validity scheme enables chains to interact with each other securely under the same rules, yet remain independently governed. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Polkadot (DOT)?\n\nThe top exchanges for Polkadot (DOT) trading are currently [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [HBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hbtc/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Binance.KR](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-kr/).

6719,The Graph,the-graph,GRT,active,token,"## What Is The Graph (GRT)?\n\n[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) and the broader [Web3 ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-graph). Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. There is a hosted service in production that makes it easy for developers to get started building on The Graph and the decentralized network will be launching later this year. The Graph currently supports indexing data from Ethereum, IPFS and POA, with more networks coming soon. \n\nTo date, over[ 3,000 subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/) have been deployed by thousands of developers, for DApps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Decentraland and many others. The Graph usage has been growing at over 50% MoM and hit over 7 billion queries during the month of September 2020. \n\nThe Graph has a global community, including over 200 Indexer Nodes in the testnet and more than 2,000 Curators in the Curator Program as of October 2020. To fund network development, The Graph raised funds from community members, strategic VCs and influential individuals in the blockchain community including Coinbase Ventures, DCG, Framework, ParaFi Capital, CoinFund, DTC, Multicoin, Reciprocal Ventures, SPC, Tally Capital and others. The Graph Foundation also successfully completed a public GRT Sale with participation from 99 countries (not including the U.S.). To date as of November 2020, The Graph has raised ~$25M.  \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of The Graph?\n\nThe Graph team includes professionals from the Ethereum Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Decentraland, Orchid, MuleSoft leading up to the IPO and acquisition by Salesforce, Puppet, Redhat and Barclays.\n\nThe initial co-founding team includes Yaniv Tal (project lead), Brandon Ramirez (research lead) and Jannis Pohlmann (tech lead). \n\nThe founders have engineering backgrounds and have worked together for 5-8 years. Tal and Ramirez studied electrical engineering at USC and worked together at MuleSoft, an API developer tools company that underwent an IPO and sold to SalesForce.  \n\nThey previously co-founded a developer tools startup together and have spent a significant portion of their careers working to optimize the API stack. At their last startup, the founders built a custom framework on an immutable database called Datomic. The Graph was born from this vision to create immutable APIs and data access, using the GraphQL query language.\n\n\n#### What Makes The Graph Unique?\n\nThe Graph is working to bring reliable decentralized public infrastructure to the mainstream market. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants use Graph Token (GRT). GRT is a work token that is locked-up by Indexers, Curators and Delegators in order to provide indexing and curating services to the network.\n\nGRT will be an ERC-20 token on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can earn income from the network proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. Indexers earn indexing rewards (new issuance) and query fees, while Curators earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on. Delegators earn a portion of income earned by the Indexer they delegate to.  \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFor more information about cryptocurrencies, check out CMC’s educational portal, [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\nCurious about the latest crypto news? Read CMC’s [blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/)!\n\n\n#### How Many The Graph (GRT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nTotal GRT supply at mainnet launch will be 10 billion tokens, with an initial circulating supply of ~1,245,666,867 GRT. New token issuance in the form of indexing rewards will begin at 3% annually and is subject to future technical governance by The Graph Council. You can read about GRT token economics [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics) and distribution information [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/announcing-the-graphs-grt-sale). \n\n\n### How Is The Graph Network Secured?\n\nThe Graph has built an open data layer on top of blockchains: Indexers can run their own Ethereum archive nodes to run Graph Node, or they can use node operators like Infura or Alchemy. \n\nAny analytics company can build an application to query subgraph data that’s indexed by The Graph. Subgraphs are open APIs to be able to pull data from the blockchain in the most seamless and efficient way.

An increasingly popular tool among cryptocurrency users, AMMs are decentralized exchanges which use smart contracts to create markets for any given pair of tokens.\n\nSushiSwap launched in September 2020 as a fork of [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), the AMM which has become synonymous with the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) movement and associated trading boom in DeFi tokens.\n\nSushiSwap aims to diversify the AMM market and also [add additional features](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/sushiswap-cookbook-a-complete-tutorial-on-sushi-defi-opportunities) not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of SushiSwap?\n\nSushiSwap was founded by the pseudonymous entity known only as [Chef Nomi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/chef-nomi). Little is known about Chef Nomi, or his or her impetus for forking off from Uniswap.\n\nThe project has two other pseudonymous co-founders, sushiswap and 0xMaki, also known as just Maki. Between them, they handle SushiSwap’s code, product development and business operations.\n\nMore recently, de facto ownership of SushiSwap was passed to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of derivatives exchange [FTX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ftx/) and quantitative trading startup Alameda Research.\n\nBankman-Fried is a well-known participant and cryptocurrency market commentator, regularly appearing in media interviews. \n\n\n#### What Makes SushiSwap Unique?\n\nSushiSwap primarily exists as an AMM, through which automated trading liquidity is set up between any two cryptocurrency assets.\n\nIts main audience is DeFi traders and associated entities looking to capitalize on the boom in project tokens and create liquidity.\n\nAMMs do away with order books entirely while avoiding problems such as liquidity issues, which hamper traditional decentralized exchanges.\n\nSushiSwap aims to improve on the offerings of its parent, Uniswap, by increasing the impact users can have on its operations and future. \n\nThe platform takes a 0.3% cut from transactions occurring in its liquidity pools, while its SUSHI token is used to reward users portions of those fees. SUSHI also entitles users to governance rights. \n\n\n##### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Uniswap’s distribution on the CMC blog [here](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/23/stablecoin-stamp-of-approval-inside-unis-distribution-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).\n\nNew to DeFi?

Check out [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/), CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education suite.\n\n\n##### How Many SushiSwap (SUSHI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nSushiSwap’s in-house token SUSHI is created at a rate of 100 tokens per block. The first 100,000 blocks had a block reward of 1,000 SUSHI.\n\nThe supply of SUSHI will depend on the block rate. At approximately 6,500 per day, and therefore 650,000 newly-minted tokens per day, there will be roughly 326 million tokens in circulation by September 2021, a year after SushiSwap first launched.\n\nSUSHI had no premine, and began to be minted at [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) block number 10,750,000, beginning with a supply of zero tokens.\n\n\n#### How Is SushiSwap Network Secured?\n\nSushiSwap attempts to mitigate the traditional risks of depositing funds in smart contracts by upping the governance powers of its users.\n\nThe anonymity of its developers poses questions beyond a technical standpoint. In September 2020, for example, Chef Nomi was involved in a spat with users after withdrawing 38,000 in Ethereum (ETH) from SushiSwap. The funds were subsequently returned, with Chef Nomi publicly apologizing for doing so and calling the move a mistake.\n\n\n#### Where Can You Buy SushiSwap (SUSHI)?\n\nSushiSwap (SUSHI) is a freely-tradable token, with the majority of volume on major exchanges occurring on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/).\n\nPairs against other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are active, as well as with fiat, including on Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

6783,Axie Infinity,axie-infinity,AXS,active,token,"## What Is Axie Infinity (AXS)?\n\nAxie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players.\n\nInspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. \n\nThese Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary — and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique.\n\nEach Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. These Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace. \n\nThe Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). These are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Axie Infinity?\n\nAxie Infinity was created in 2018 by Sky Mavis — a technology-focused game developer with a team primarily based in Vietnam. It was co-founded by Trung Nguyen and Aleksander Larsen. \n\nTrung Nguyen is the current CEO of the platform. Nguyen graduated with a BS in computer software engineering, and worked as a software engineer at Anduin Transactions prior to founding Axie Infinity. \n\nFormer competitive gamer Aleksander Larsen is also credited as a co-founder and COO of the platform. Larsen has been working in [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) gaming since 2017. He previously worked as the executive security officer for the Norwegian Government Security Organization and still sits as Secretary of the Board of Directors at the Blockchain Game Alliance. \n\nIn total, the Axie Infinity team consists of 25 full-time employees — many of whom have experience with game development. \n\n\n#### What Makes Axie Infinity Unique?\n\nEach Axie possesses six out of the hundreds of different potential body parts — each of which has its own battle move. This produces essentially endless variety among Axies, with most Axies having relatively weak statistics, while those with the strongest combination of body parts can have incredible stats.\n\nUnlike some other blockchain-based battling and breeding games, each Axie can only be bred a total of seven times to help control the population of Axies. \n\nAxie Infinity has its own mating hub to help players find a suitable match to breed their Axie with to stand the best chance at producing a rare or powerful offspring. It costs 0.005 ETH in addition to Small Love Potion (SLP) tokens to breed Axies.\n\nAXS token holders will soon be able to [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens to receive regular rewards. But unlike some other stakeable assets, AXS holders will also need to vote and play to claim their rewards.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) — the blockchain that hosts the Axie Infinity game.\n\nCheck out [Small Love Potion (SLP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/small-love-potion/news/) — the token needed to breed Axies.\n\nRead about [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\n\nDiscover the latest crypto insights, news and tools with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Axie Infinity (AXS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAxie Infinity (AXS) tokens have a total supply of 270 million tokens. Out of this, around 53.5 million tokens were in circulation as of mid-November 2020.\n\nIn total, 11% of the total supply was allocated to participants in the Binance Launchpad [IEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) sale and 4% was sold in a private sale. In addition to this, 29% is allocated for staking rewards, 20% to the play to earn pool, 21% to the team, 7% to advisors and 8% to the ecosystem fund.\n\nBased on the current release schedule, as indicated by [Binance Research](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/axie-infinity), 100% of AXS tokens will be circulating by early 2026.\n\n\n### How Is the Axie Infinity Network Secured?\n\nThe Axie Infinity (AXS) token is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token launched on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus mechanism. \n\nIn early 2021, Axie Infinity plans to migrate its NFT tokens, including Axies, Land and other in-game item tokens from the Loom Network to a custom-built sidechain on Ethereum known as Ronin. \n\nRonin is an application-specific sidechain built just for Axie Infinity. It is being developed by Sky Mavis — the development firm behind the Axie Infinity game, and is designed to support almost instant transaction confirmations, reduced gas fees and be capable of helping Axie Infinity scale.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Axie Infinity (AXS)?\n\nAs of mid-November 2020, Axie Infinity (AXS) is only available to trade on a single exchange platform: [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/). It is listed with four trading pairs: AXS/USDT, AXS/BTC, AXS/BUSD and AXS/BNB. \n\nThough there are no direct fiat purchase options for AXS, see our guide to purchasing [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) with fiat — which can then be exchanged to AXS on supported exchanges.",AxieInfinity,Holders will be able to access new features (breeding and staking in the future) if they upgrade their AXS/SLP. This can be done from Axieinfinity.com starting Wednesday 28 of April 2021.

6928,Bella Protocol,bella-protocol,BEL,active,token,"## What Is Bella Protocol (BEL)?\n\nBella Protocol is a platform that provides a suite of DeFi products designed to make crypto banking simpler and more accessible. The protocol aims to create a better user experience by eliminating the high fee and slow transaction issues that can affect some [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platforms — while simultaneously improving the user experience through its simplified DeFi smart portal. \n\nBella's smart pool feature allows users to access the best yields available in the DeFi market, while benefiting from nearly zero [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) — since these are directly subsidized by the platform. \n\nThe project launched in September 2020 as the first project distributed via [Binance’s](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) Launchpool platform, and has secured investments from several prominent firms, including Arrington XRP Capital and Ledger Capital. \n\nThe protocol was built by the ARPA team, a blockchain-based layer 2 solution for privacy-preserving computation. The BEL token is an essential component of the Bella Protocol ecosystem and serves as both a reward token that allows holders to participate in the governance of the platform.\n\nBEL can be used to farm fee rewards from the network, get exclusive discounts on Bella protocol products (such as its robo-advisor tool), and for earning staking rewards. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Bella Protocol?\n\nBella Protocol was co-founded by Felix Xu and Yemu Xu in 2020 and currently has its headquarters in Beijing, China. \n\nFelix Xu is the CEO of Bella and also the co-founder of ARPA, a privacy-preserving blockchain platform that incubated the Bella Protocol. Felix has several years of experience as a venture investor and analyst and is a veteran of the financial industry. Yemu, on the other hand, is a heavily experienced entrepreneur, with a history of analyst and consultant roles.\n\nThe rest of the Bella team overlaps with that of ARPA, which is composed of more than a dozen employees with a range of backgrounds in blockchain, finance, and product development. \n\n\n### What Makes Bella Protocol Unique?\n\nOne of Bella Protocol’s main features is its simplified user experience and wide variety of products. \n\nThe platform consists of the following main products: the Bella Liquidity Mining platform, flexible savings, a one-click smart portal to deploy assets with zero gas fees on popular and profitable DeFi products, a lending platform, and the Robo-Advisor — which can be used to help with the investment selection process. \n\nDespite launching in September 2020, all of these products are already operational. \n\nThe platform is supported by BEL token holders, which are able to contribute to the governance of the platform by voting on potential upgrades, releases, and other parameters. It also serves as a reward for users that participate in staking — among other things. \n\nBella Protocol is a strategic move made by ARPA in order to extend its growing community into the DeFi sector through its familiar and simple to use mobile banking application. \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nCheck out [Hard Protocol (HARD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hard-protocol/) — a similar DeFi protocol built on Kava.\n\nRead about [Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ocean-protocol/) — one of the most popular oracle networks for DeFi products.\n\nLearn how to use Uniswap with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap).\n\nFor the latest news, market updates, tricks, and tips, check out the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Bella Protocol (BEL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBella Protocol has a total supply of 100,000,000 BEL tokens and an initial circulating supply of 13,250,000 BEL.\n\nA large proportion of the initial supply was distributed via a Binance Launchpool, with 5% of the total supply allocated to participants. In addition, 6% of the total supply was sold in a private sale and 2% was sold through a public auction. \n\nThe private sale price was $0.75 per token and was conducted on August 18th, 2020 selling 6,000,000 BEL to raise $4.5 million. \n\nBeyond this, 18% of the total supply is reserved for the ecosystem, 4% for the reserve, 40% for user growth, 10% for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) rewards, and 15% for the team. Based on the expected rate of token releases, the BEL token should reach full dilution by ~2025. \n\nHow Is the Bella Protocol Secured?\n\nThe BEL token is an [ERC-20 token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) that is secured by the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network. This is secured by currently secured by an extensive mining network, which acts to ensure the network remains in [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) about which transactions are valid, and which are not. \n\nRight now, Ethereum uses the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus algorithm to maintain its integrity, but this will gradually be transitioned to [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) with the release of [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0). \n\nThe benefit of using a well-established [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) like Ethereum is that there are already more than 10,000 nodes in operation, helping to keep the network running smoothly. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Bella Protocol (BEL)?\n\nAs of December 2020, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) is by far the most liquid exchange for BEL. Beyond this, the token is available to trade at a variety of other exchange platforms, including MXC, Hotbit, and Binance Korea.

6951,Reef,reef,REEF,active,token,"## What Is Reef (REEF)?\n\nReef is a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) platform built on [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/) that aims to deliver cross-chain trading. A yield engine and a smart liquidity aggregator are among the project’s offerings.\n\nWork began on the project in the second half of 2020. Those behind Reef argue that the process of trading, lending and staking crypto is currently fragmented — creating “a painful experience for all of its participants.”\n\nReef aggregates liquidity and provides automation. It also aims to address the drawbacks associated with existing trading platforms. While centralized exchanges are prone to security breaches, decentralized rivals can lack liquidity and are often difficult to use.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Reef?\n\nReef was founded by Denko Mancheski. His motivation was to remove technical barriers to entry for retail investors who want to get involved with DeFi — and offer a straightforward decision-making process that takes a user’s appetite for risk into account.\n\nMancheski wanted to help crypto newcomers overcome the complexities associated with using order books, and enable them to learn how different protocols work with ease.\n\nBorn in Macedonia, Mancheski said that his passion for fintech led to him being introduced to blockchain technology. He has described forming a competent team as the biggest challenge associated with bringing Reef to life. \n\nWhen asked about the personal attributes that will help him become a successful entrepreneur, he added: “I have a very addictive personality — I just can’t stop doing something until I get to the imaginary goal that I set for myself.”\n\nMancheski previously worked as a chief technology officer for Adel, a global crypto community that serves as a “technology incubator for blockchain innovation.” He was also appointed as CTO for Viewly, a social video platform without advertisements.\n\n\n#### What Makes Reef Unique?\n\nReef is geared towards newcomers, as well as current DeFi users who find it difficult to keep up with the best investment strategies. The company also wants to tackle the high gas fees that are seen on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain, which some claim renders DeFi protocols “unusable.”\n\nWhen it comes to Reef’s unique attributes, one is linked to how any DeFi protocol can integrate into its operating system. Users can enter and exit into their chosen positions in a single click — and removes some of the hassle associated with managing liquidity pool tokens.\n\nBecause of how it has been built on Polkadot, Reef is able to support DeFi protocols on Avalanche, Moonbeam and Plasma, as well as on Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain. As a result, Reef users have access to a broader number of platforms without requiring multiple accounts and a myriad of usernames and passwords that can be difficult to keep track of.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nFind out more about [Polkadot](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot).\n\nCheck out our [deep dive into decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nLearn about cryptocurrencies with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/).\n\nSubscribe to the [CoinMarketCap newsletter](https://coinmarketcap.com/newsletter).\n\n\n#### How Many Reef (REEF) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAt present, REEF has a circulating supply of above three billion tokens. When it comes to the total token supply, approximately 3% has been allocated to Binance Launchpool, while 21% has been distributed to investors through token sales. The Reef team holds 16% of the supply and a specially created foundation has 17.5%, with about 12.5% earmarked for developing the ecosystem. The remaining 30% is devoted to protocol emissions and liquidity rewards, and tokens are going to be gradually released between now and the end of 2025.\n\n\n### How Is the Reef Network Secured?\n\nAccording to Reef, the network is secured under the shared security model operated by Polkadot. Not only does this make the network resilient, but it also means that upgrades can be performed without forks.\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization has also been established that is governed by those who hold REEF tokens.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Reef (REEF)?\n\nREEF is available on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in two trading pairs — linking this token with [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and the [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) stablecoin. It has also been listed on Bilaxy. REEF can also be acquired through the decentralized [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) exchange using Wrapped Ether and USDT.

6992,Spartan Protocol,spartan-protocol,SPARTA,active,token,"## What Is Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)?\n\nThe Spartan Protocol is intended to provide incentives for deep capital formation in liquidity pools with safe and sustainable creation of synthetic assets. It claims to be the first major liquidity project on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)), which was chosen thanks to its near-instantaneous settlements and low gas fees. \n\nThe Spartan Protocol is a liquidity protocol for asset exchange and synthetic asset generation on the BSC; its foundation are the liquidity pools, similarly to Uniswap. Instead of a fixed-rate fee model, it uses a liquidity-sensitive fee model.\n\nThe Spartan Protocol uses elements of other well-established projects to create a platform that runs on the BSC instead of the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) network.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Spartan Protocol?\n\nThe Spartan Protocol project has been developed in a decentralized manner from the moment of its inception and has no official team or treasury.\n\n\n#### What Makes Spartan Protocol Unique?\n\nSpartanPools are Spartan Protocol’s incentivized liquidity pools that drive on-market capital formation. The liquidity pools are facilitated by an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) algorithm that has liquidity-sensitive fees. The fees are there to ensure that the system can detect correct token purchasing at all times, allowing for scalable and risk-tolerant growth.\n\nSpartanSynths is a protocol that allows for the generation of synthetic assets through the use of price anchors offered by its own liquidity pools and collateralized by liquidity pool shares. The liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilized and can be instantly liquidated. Liquidity-sensitive fees ensure that positions taken up will scale with the depth of the available liquidity, preventing the deleveraging spirals that are common in many similar systems.\n\nSpartanLending works when synthetic token minters short the value of their tokens and long the value of their collateral. By winding up their position they can achieve leverage. The opposite is true for those that want to long a token with leverage. Lending is possible through the use of a system of fees and collateralized debt. The liquidation of unhealthy positions is done instantly through liquidity pools.\n\nSpartanDAO is a mechanism that is used to govern the entire ecosystem and distribute protocol incentives.\n\nSPARTA is a fixed-supply network asset that coordinates participation and incentivizes capital formation for synthetic assets and lending. The SPARTA token was initially distributed through a process known as proof-of-burn, where participants could choose to burn their assets in return for a share of the initial supply of 100,000,000 SPARTA tokens. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [WaykiChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waykichain/).\n\nLearn more about [Nexo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nexo/).\n\nLearn how to gift someone crypto on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-gift-someone-crypto).\n\nExpand your knowledge of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Spartan Protocol (SPARTA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nSpartan Protocol (SPARTA) has a circulating supply of 64,147,511 tokens and a maximum supply of 300,000,000 SPARTA as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Spartan Protocol Network Secured?\n\nSpartan Protocol is based on the Binance Smart Chain, a VM-compatible delegated proof-of-stake ([DPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) blockchain with fast block times and a focus on decentralization.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Spartan Protocol (SPARTA)?\n\nSpartan Protocol (SPARTA) can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [BurgerSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/burgerswap/)\n*   [Anyswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/anyswap/)\n\nCheck out CoinMarketCap’s guide on how to [buy Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) and other cryptocurrencies to learn more.\n",spartanprotocol,,"binance-chain, binance-smart-chain","Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain","https://spartanprotocol.org/, https://spartanswap.org/",https://twitter.com/SpartanProtocol,"https://medium.com/@spartanprotocol, https://t.me/SpartanProtocolAnn",https://t.me/SpartanProtocolOrg,https://bscscan.com/token/0xe4ae305ebe1abe663f261bc00534067c80ad677c,https://reddit.com/r/spartanprotocol,https://github.com/spartan-protocol/resources/blob/master/whitepaper.pdf,https://github.com/spartan-protocol,https://medium.com/@spartanprotocol/announcing-the-spartan-protocol-e15af93a8a8f,1839,2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,,True

The reward multiplier for each will vary based on the value they provide to BAKE holders. \n\nBakerySwap charges a 0.30% fee on all swaps and trades, out of which 0.25% go to liquidity providers.\n\nThe liquidity providers are then given liquidity pool tokens that represent their share of each pool. Through these tokens, they can earn a portion of the fees that are collected in the pools when removing the liquidity. Liquidity providers can then stake Bakery LP tokens to farm BAKE token rewards. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Universe](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/universe/).\n\nLearn about [Klaytn](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klaytn/).\n\nLearn about Crypto ETFs on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-etf).\n\nStay in the loop about everything cryptocurrency on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n### How Is the BakeryToken Network Secured?\n\nThe BakeryToken network is secured through the use of real-time security monitors and intelligence systems.

7083,Uniswap,uniswap,UNI,active,token,"## What Is Uniswap (UNI)?\n\n[Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) tokens.\n\nAn example of an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), Uniswap launched in November 2018, but has gained considerable popularity this year thanks to the DeFi phenomenon and associated surge in token trading.\n\nUniswap aims to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens, while improving the efficiency of trading versus that on traditional exchanges.\n\nUniswap creates more efficiency by solving liquidity issues with automated solutions, avoiding the problems which plagued the first decentralized exchanges.\n\nIn September 2020, Uniswap went a step further by creating and awarding its own governance token, UNI, to past users of the protocol. This added both profitability potential and the ability for users to shape its future — an attractive aspect of decentralized entities.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Uniswap?\n\nUniswap came about as a plan to introduce AMMs on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to a wider audience. The platform’s creator is Ethereum developer Hayden Adams.\n\nAdams worked in various projects while finalizing Uniswap, and his work was informed directly by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin even ended up giving the protocol its name — it was originally known as Unipeg.\n\nAdams has also said that the original inspiration for the [Uniswap platform](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap) came from one of Buterin’s own blog posts. His original idea to focus on Ethereum came after a friend convinced him to begin researching and understanding the protocol in 2017.\n\n\n### What Makes Uniswap Unique?\n\nUniswap exists to create liquidity — and therefore trading and the value that trading provides —\xa0for the DeFi sphere.\n\nOne of the major AMMs in operation at present, the protocol functions using a formula for automated exchange — X x Y = K. Founder Hayden Adams describes himself as the inventor of the particular implementation of the formula on Uniswap.\n\nUniswap is not just a decentralized exchange; it attempts to solve the issues that platforms such as [EtherDelta](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/etherdelta/) experienced with liquidity. \n\nBy automating the process of market making, the protocol inceventizes activity by limiting risk and reducing costs for all parties. The mechanism also removes identity requirements for users, and technically anyone can create a liquidity pool for any pair of tokens.\n\nAccording to Uniswap, their governance token (UNI) was created in order to “officially enshrin[e] Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.”\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Balancer [here](https://balancer.finance/).\n\nLearn more about Curve [here](https://www.curve.fi/).\n\nNew to DeFi and cryptocurrency? Check out our education resources [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\n[Uniswap vs Pancakeswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/uniswap-vs-pancakeswap)\n\n### How Many Uniswap (UNI) Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of Uniswap’s governance token, UNI, is 1 billion units. These will become available over the course of four years, after which Uniswap will introduce a “perpetual inflation rate” of 2% to maintain network participation. \n\nToken distribution currently consists of the following: 60% to Uniswap community members, i.e. users, 21.51% to team members, 17.8% to investors and 0.69% to advisors. The latter three distributions will occur according to a four-year vesting schedule.\n\nOut of the majority set to go to users, 15% can be claimed by those who used Uniswap prior to Sep. 1, 2020. These even include users who submitted transactions which were never successful — they are eligible for 400 UNI.\n\n\n### How Is the Uniswap Network Secured?\n\nUniswap is a decentralized protocol for trading, and UNI is its in-house governance token. UNI is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, meaning it requires Ethereum to function. \n\nERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants.\n\nSeparately, [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) can cause security issues that could lead to DeFi traders losing funds; in fact, hackers have already succeeded in stealing millions of dollars in DeFi’s short lifetime as of fall 2020.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Uniswap (UNI)?\n\nUniswap’s UNI governance token is available for trading on major exchanges against other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and more. \n\nThese include Binance, OKEx and Coinbase Pro, along with, naturally, Uniswap’s protocol itself.\n\nYou can read more about how to enter the cryptocurrency market, no matter what token you plan to purchase, [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).",Uniswap,,"decentralized-exchange, defi, dao, yield-farming, amm, coinbase-ventures-portfolio, three-arrows-capital-portfolio, governance, blockchain-capital-portfolio, defiance-capital, alameda-research-portfolio, a16z-portfolio, pantera-capital-portfolio, parafi-capital, paradigm-xzy-screener","Decentralized exchange, DeFi, DAO, Yield farming, AMM, Coinbase Ventures Portfolio, Three Arrows Capital Portfolio, Governance, Blockchain Capital Portfolio, DeFiance Capital, Alameda Research Portfolio, A16Z Portfolio, Pantera Capital Portfolio, ParaFi capital, Paradigm XZY Screener","https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/, https://uniswap.org/",https://twitter.com/Uniswap,https://uniswap.org/blog/,https://discord.gg/FCfyBSbCU5,"https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984, https://bscscan.com/token/0xbf5140a22578168fd562dccf235e5d43a02ce9b1, https://hecoinfo.com/token/0x22c54ce8321a4015740ee1109d9cbc25815c46e6, https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tokens/0x4537e328bf7e4efa29d05caea260d7fe26af9d74/token-transfers",https://reddit.com/r/Uniswap,,,,1027,2020-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,,True

7102,Linear,linear,LINA,active,token,"## What Is Linear (LINA)?\n\nLinear is a decentralized delta-one asset protocol capable of instantly creating synthetic assets with unlimited liquidity. The project opens traditional assets like commodities, forex, market indices and other thematic sectors to cryptocurrency users by supporting the creation of “Liquids” — Linear’s synthetic asset tokens. \n\nThe protocol consists of various products like Linear.Buildr, a DApp used to manage Liquids using Linear (LINA) and other tokens as collateral. The exchange is specifically created to enable trading of a variety of Liquids with rapid confirmation times and robust security. \n\nLINA is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum network whose main purpose is as collateral for Liquids (using Buildr) and for community governance of the protocol. All token holders have access to the Linear DAO, enabling them to vote on different initiatives and proposals, helping to shape the development of the Linear ecosystem.\n\nThe main goal of Linear is to provide a superior user experience with better scalability and greater speed thanks to the cross-chain capabilities of the protocol. Linear Finance intends to provide a simple solution for users that want exposure to traditional assets while still benefiting from the features enabled only by [blockchain technology](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Linear?\n\nLinear Finance was co-founded by Drey Ng and Kevin Tai and has a small team of less than a dozen individuals according to the official Linear Finance [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linearfinance/). \n\nDrey Ng is co-founder and current chief product officer of Liquefy, a platform that offers access to tokenized securities by lowering the barriers to entry. He is also a blockchain instructor in Hong Kong and has several years of experience in the fintech industry.\n\nKevin Tai was the vice president of Credit Suisse in Hong Kong, a prominent global wealth manager and an investment bank. He graduated from Harvard Business School and has more than a decade of experience in the economy sector.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Linear Unique?\n\nAlthough Linear Finance is built on top of the Ethereum network, the protocol allows users to access other supported chains and transfer assets to them. In addition to digital assets, Linear enables customers to access traditional assets like forex and commodities through dynamic price feeds which act to solve the systemic front-running problem that occurs with many decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) protocols. \n\nLINA tokens serve as the base collateral to mint Liquids. However, customers can also use other digital assets like ETH and wBTC to cover 20% of this base collateral. The Linear Exchange provides unlimited liquidity for Liquids and lowers the settlement timeframe to as low as one second per block — making it suitable for high-frequency traders and those running algorithmic trading software. \n\nIn time, Linear Finance users will be able to access synthetic traditional assets and ultimately equities in the near-term. The cross-chain approach helps Linear reduce fees and solves the [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) frontrunning issue that can occur with some existing protocols on Ethereum. \n\nOne of Linear Finance’s most unique features is its proposed liquidation mechanism, which will be decided based on community governance. LINA holders are able to help choose transaction fees and how much to allocate to the insurance fund, among other options by voting.  \n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nCheck out [Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alpha-finance-lab/) — a cross-chain [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) and lending protocol.\n\n[Cream Finance (CREAM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cream-finance/) is another DeFi platform that provides lending, borrowing and swapping services.\n\nLearn how to use Uniswap with [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap).\n\nFor the latest news, market updates, tricks, and tips, check out the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Linear (LINA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of LINA is currently 10 billion tokens. Linear utilizes an inflationary system with a decreasing rate until a terminal floor is reached. The inflation rate is initially set at 75%, but this decreases at 1.5% per week—  and is subject to modification if a [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) is achieved by the LinearDAO.\n\nLinear Finance secured a $1.8 million investment from reputable seed investors like Alameda Research, NGC Ventures and Hashed. In addition, the project conducted a small initial coin offering (ICO) in September 2020, raising a total of $310,000 by selling LINA tokens at $0.005 with a personal cap of $500 per participant. \n\nOf the total supply, 40% is reserved for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) rewards, 15% for the Linear Finance reserve, and 10% to the ecosystem. The team also has a 10% allocation, while advisors have 5% — both team and advisor tokens are subject to a vesting schedule. \n\nAs per [early projections](https://medium.com/linear-finance/linear-finance-token-metrics-f0ccb1587751) by the Linear team, 40% of the LINA supply will be in circulation around 40 months after the genesis event, though this may be lower due to potential token burns. \n\n\n### How Is the Linear Finance Network Secured?\n\nAs an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token built on the Ethereum Network, Linear leverages one of the largest [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) mining networks to secure its tokens. \n\n \\\nOn top of this, the LinearDAO was created to give LINA holders the power to vote on proposals that help ensure the Linear Finance ecosystem develops along the path desired by its users. The actual Linear Finance delta.one asset protocol is trustless and based on Ethereum [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), which can be updated should the need arise. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Linear Finance (LINA)?\n\nLINA is listed on popular centralized exchanges like BitMax and MXC, in addition to the popular  decentralized exchange, Uniswap. As of November 2020, the token can be traded against [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), or against wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) on [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/). \n\nIf you’re looking to purchase LINA or other cryptocurrencies with a credit or debit card, check out our [simple guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to get started.",,,"decentralized-exchange, defi, yield-farming, binance-smart-chain, polkadot-ecosystem, cms-holdings-portfolio, kinetic-capital, alameda-research-portfolio","Decentralized exchange, DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot Ecosystem, CMS Holdings Portfolio, Kinetic Capital, Alameda Research Portfolio",https://linear.finance,https://twitter.com/LinearFinance,,"https://telegram.me/Tb3iAhuMZsyfspxhEWQLvw, https://discord.com/invite/emFXWaq","https://etherscan.io/token/0x3e9bc21c9b189c09df3ef1b824798658d5011937, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3e9bc21c9b189c09df3ef1b824798658d5011937, https://bscscan.com/token/0x762539b45a1dcce3d36d080f74d1aed37844b878",,,,https://medium.com/@linear.finance,1027,2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,,True
7150,Flamingo,flamingo,FLM,active,token,"## What Is Flamingo (FLM)?\n\nFlamingo is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) platform based on the Neo [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) and the Poly Network interoperability protocol. It combines several DeFi applications into a single ecosystem: a cross-blockchain asset gateway (wrapper), an on-blockchain [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool) (swap), a blockchain asset vault, a perpetual contract trading platform (perp) and a decentralized governance organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)).\n\nDifferent components of the Flamingo network are planned to be launched in several phases:\n\n\n\n*   Token wrapper for Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, Neo, Ontology and others: September 23, 2020\n*   Swap and LP token staking: September 30, 2020\n*   Phase 3 vault launch and stablecoin issuance: October 28, 2020\n*   Perp launch: November 25, 2020\n*   DAO launch: December 23, 2020\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Flamingo?\n\nThe founder of Flamingo is Da Hongfei, a Chinese entrepreneur also known for co-founding one of the main competitors of Ethereum: the blockchain network Neo, which Flamingo is based on. Hongfei has also co-founded OnChain, a private blockchain services company.\n\nDa Hongfei has a degree in English and technology from the South China University of Technology and has worked as the CEO of the IntPass Consulting firm prior to teaching himself how to code and entering the blockchain scene in 2013-2014.\n\n\n#### What Makes Flamingo Unique?\n\nFlamingo positions itself as a singular platform that combines multiple decentralized finance tools for Neo into a common ecosystem that will be governed by its users via a decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nDecentralized finance is a nascent, fast-growing trend in the cryptocurrency industry that encompasses various financial solutions that often operate on top of cryptocurrency blockchains. Working as a sort of second-layer industry, DeFi platforms are conceptually aligned with the idea of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole: eliminating third parties and singular points of failure from monetary and financial systems. Having emerged in early 2019, by mid-2020 the DeFi industry already boasted over $4 billion in locked collateral assets.\n\nSome of the main use cases in DeFi are cryptocurrency lending, [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) and decentralized exchanges. However, for most cryptocurrencies and their respective DeFi environments, each of these solutions is usually provided by a single separate platform.\n\nFlamingo’s unique advantage comes from the fact that it’s aiming to combine all the key financial instruments for the Neo cryptocurrency token (token wrapping, liquidity pooling, asset vault and contract trading) and make them available via a single platform that will be governed by its own users in a decentralized way.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages**:\n\nTo read more about Neo, click [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/).\n\nOur educational portal [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics) has tips and guides for learning more about crypto.\n\nCheck out CoinMarketCap’s blog [here](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Flamingo (FLM) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nFLM tokens are planned to be issued in several batches and distributed among the ecosystem’s participants based on their actual participation in the network. Flamingo’s team emphasizes the fact that no FLM tokens will be sold, minted or given to the platform’s team prior to its public launch.\n\nDuring the first week after the launch of the Flamingo Vault — the so-called “mint rush” period — 50 million FLM are to be distributed among staking pools.\n\nAfter the launch of Flamingo Swap (week 2-5), 40 million more FLM will be distributed to liquidity providers.\n\nDuring week 6-9, an additional 30 million FLM will be distributed among liquidity providers and FUSD minters.\n\nFinally, during week 10-13, another 30 million FLM are set to be distributed between liquidity providers, FUSD minters and Flamingo Perp traders.\n\nThere is no upper limit on the total FLM supply: after the initial period of minting and the launch of the governing decentralized autonomous organization, the issuance of new FLM tokens and their distribution will be subject to the [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) of the ecosystem’s users.\n\n\n### How Is the Flamingo Network Secured?\n\nFLM is based on NEP-5, Neo’s token compatibility standard, so it is secured by Neo’s blockchain. In turn, Neo is secured by two hash functions: [SHA-256](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256) (the same one Bitcoin [[BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)] is secured by) and RIPEMD-160.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Flamingo (FLM)?\n\nAs of October 2020, FLM token trading is not yet available at any of the cryptocurrency exchanges and can only be received via direct participation in the Flamingo network. We will update this page when FLM starts trading on publicly available exchanges.",,,"defi, dao, yield-farming, binance-chain, binance-launchpool","DeFi, DAO, Yield farming, Binance Chain, Binance Launchpool",https://flamingo.finance/,https://twitter.com/FlamingoFinance,https://medium.com/flamingo-finance,https://discord.gg/xGp9gbM,https://neotube.io/nep5/4d9eab13620fe3569ba3b0e56e2877739e4145e3/page/1,,https://docs.flamingo.finance/,,,1376,2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,,True

It was built without the control of any centralized authorities through the use of smart contracts.\n\nBurger Swap is based on the DEMAX decentralized Binance platform; it enables a swapping mechanism with democratic procedures that allows the community to change system parameters through transparent voting.\n\nBURGER token staking allows any user to create proposals and influence the adjustment of transaction fees, block rewards and other system parameters of the Burger Swap exchange via voting.\n\nThe Burger Swap decentralized governance system was designed to prevent control by any centralized entity. Users are rewarded with BURGER tokens for creating liquidity, staking and voting within the governance system.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Burger Swap?\n\nBurger Swap is an implementation of ERC-2917 founded by Tony Carson and Drs. Mehmet Sabir and Suleyman Kardas. Its main aim is to improve on Uniswap through altering the incentive and governance models.\n\n\n#### What Makes Burger Swap Unique?\n\nAn automated market maker is a type of decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) that uses mathematical formulae and game theory to price assets. Burger Swap is a decentralized AMM on the BSC network.\n\nThe Burger Swap Bridge has the ability to swap coins from the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) network’s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard to the BSC’s BEP-20 standard — and vice-versa — at low fees. It allows Ethereum users to seamlessly migrate to the BSC network and enjoy its low transaction fees and fast block times.\n\nBurger Swap was designed as a democratic and decentralized exchange with compulsory governance. BURGER token holders can vote to alter the exchange parameters such as trading fees, mining speed, staking rewards and others. \n\nAll tokens available on Burger Swap have a [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) and a BURGER trading pair.

7182,BillionHappiness,billionhappiness,BHC,active,token,"## What Is BillionHappiness (BHC)?\n\nBillionHappiness is an online clothing company that aims to provide transparent and accurate information about its products via blockchain technology. The goal is to remove counterfeit products from the market by offering and promoting authentic digital products. The company aims to encourage product ownership through blockchain.\n\nIt uses the unique features of blockchain technology to provide open transaction records of supply, inventory, in-stock items and more. The company rewards its customers with its native BillionHappiness Community (BHC) token for every purchase. \n\nBHC is used as a cashback reward program for purchasing products in the store and can be earned via staking or farming pools. Some products offered by the company include face shields, polo shirts and others.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of BillionHappiness?\n\nBillionHappiness was launched in September 2020 by its co-founders, one of which is known as Arnel. \n\n\n#### What Makes BillionHappiness Unique?\n\nThe upsurge of counterfeit products in many e-commerce stores has become a challenge for online shoppers. BillionHappiness seeks to promote the sale of authentic products through blockchain technology. The company makes sure to maintain open and reliable information about its products and transactions. In order to promote honest transactions and incentivize purchasing, it offers BHC rewards to the customers.\n\nBHC can be used to stake, farm or purchase other products on the platform. Clients earn a 3% cash-back in BHC for every product sold in the store. They can either trade the rewards on an exchange or use them to pay for more goods in the store.\n\nThe company uses a portion of the profits made from the sales in the store to buy back BHC from exchanges like [JulSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/julswap/) and [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/). Other projects similar to BillionHappiness include [Aora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aora/) and [OpenSea](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hashmasks-become-the-most-traded-nfts-on-opensea-in-a-single-week-flipside-crypto).\n\n\n#### How Many BillionHappiness (BHC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBHC is a BEP-20-compliant token that was launched on September 14, 2020, on the Binance Smart Chain.

7186,PancakeSwap,pancakeswap,CAKE,active,token,"## What Is PancakeSwap (CAKE)?\n\nPancakeSwap is an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) — a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi)) application that allows users to exchange tokens, providing liquidity via farming and earning fees in return.\n\nIt launched in September 2020 and is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model where users trade against a liquidity pool. These pools are filled by users who deposit their funds into the pool and receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return.\n\nThese tokens can later be used to reclaim their share of the pool, as well as a portion of the trading fees. These LP tokens are known as FLIP. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens such as CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens and get rewarded with CAKE. \n\nPancakeSwap allows users to trade BEP20 tokens, provide liquidity to the exchange and earn fees, stake LP tokens to earn CAKE, stake CAKE to earn more CAKE and stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of PancakeSwap?\n\nPancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) that was launched by anonymous developers with an apparent passion for pancakes.\n\n\n#### What Makes PancakeSwap Unique?\n\nPancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model, meaning that there are no order books and liquidity pools are used instead. A user can earn income by becoming a liquidity provide; by adding their tokens to the liquidity pool they can farm LP tokens and stake their CAKE to earn rewards. They can also try their luck with the lotteries and non-fungible tokens. \n\nThe PancakeSwap token CAKE is a BEP20 token that originally launched on Binance Smart Chain. The main function of CAKE is to incentivize the liquidity provision to the PancakeSwap platform.\n\nUsers can stake their tokens to earn rewards, which is done by depositing Liquidity Provider tokens and locking them up. This is known as farming and is rewarded by the system with CAKE tokens. The tokens can be un-staked with zero holding time. CAKE gives users the opportunity to invest and increase returns in the future but comes with risks.\n\nCAKE can be used to enter a lottery on PancakeSwap. Each lottery session takes 6 hours. A single ticket costs 10 CAKE and comes with a random combination of four numbers between 1 and 14, for example, 8-6-4-13. To win the jackpot, which equals 50% of the entire lottery pool, the numbers in your ticket need to match all four of the numbers in the winning ticket.\n\nUsers can also win non-fungible tokens that can be traded for CAKE or kept in a wallet.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Waves](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waves/).\n\nLearn about [Vertcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vertcoin/).\n\nLearn about Dego Finance on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-dego-finance-dego).\n\nIncrease your knowledge of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many PancakeSwap (CAKE) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of March 2021, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has a circulating supply of 125,984,870 CAKE coins and no maximum supply data is available.\n\n\n### How Is the PancakeSwap Network Secured?\n\nPancakeSwap can be securely stored on supported wallets that are connected to the Binance Smart Chain. These include MetaMask, TrustWallet, TokenPocket and WalletConnect.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy PancakeSwap (CAKE)?\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) can be bought and sold on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [VCC Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/vcc-exchange/)\n*   [BKEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bkex/)\n*   [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/)\n*   [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/)\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to purchase Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)), you can read CoinMarketCap’s comprehensive [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n",,,"decentralized-exchange, defi, yield-farming, binance-chain, amm, binance-smart-chain","Decentralized exchange, DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Chain, AMM, Binance Smart Chain",https://pancakeswap.finance/,https://twitter.com/pancakeswap,https://medium.com/@pancakeswap,https://t.me/PancakeSwap,https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82,,,https://github.com/pancakeswap,,1839,2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,,True

7224,DODO,dodo,DODO,active,token,"## What Is DODO?\n\nDODO is a Chinese [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) protocol and on-chain liquidity provider whose unique proactive market maker (PMM) algorithm aims to offer better liquidity and price stability than [automated market makers (AMM).](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) \n\nThe PMM pricing mechanism, which mimics human trading, utilizes [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) to gather highly accurate market prices for assets. It then provides enough liquidity close to these prices in order to stabilize the portfolios of [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) (LP), lower price slippage and negate [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) by allowing arbitrage trading as reward. \n\nDODO also caters for new crypto projects with a free [ICO listing](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) through its Initial DODO Offering (IDO) which requires issuers to only deposit their own tokens. \n\nDODO’s smart contract operates as an [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network. \n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of DODO?\n\nDodo was officially [launched in August 2020](https://medium.com/dodoex/dodo-a-revolution-in-on-chain-liquidity-7bc339b9d391), founded by [Diane Dai](https://twitter.com/diane_0320?lang=en), [Radar Bear](https://twitter.com/bear_radar) and an anonymous development team. It initially attracted a $600,000 seed round led by Framework Ventures.\n\nThe team announced in September 2020 that it had successfully completed an additional $5 million private sale funding round, led by Pantera Capital, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) Labs and Three Arrows Capital. \n\nThe private sale round also attracted investment from several other prominent venture capital firms, cryptocurrency exchanges and trading firms that include Coinbase Ventures, Galaxy Digital, CMS Holdings and Alameda Research.\n\n\n## What Makes DODO Unique?\n\nDODO positions itself as one of the most competitive liquidity providers that offers very low transaction fees and price slippage through its PMM algorithm, first conceived in April 2020. \n\nThe team claims their PMM algorithm provides superior pricing over that of AMM competitor [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) due to a flatter price curve. \n\nThe PMM collects funds near market prices to establish enough liquidity, which drops quickly the further the price moves from the market price. DODO automatically adjusts market prices in order to attract arbitrage that will help keep liquidity provider portfolios stable. \n\nThis ensures more favorable pricing, higher fund utilization and decreased price slippage, single risk exposure and no impermanent loss [(explained here)](https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/advantages).\n\nFor traders, DODO offers sufficient liquidity comparable to that of centralized exchanges (CEX), which can be natively used by smart contracts for on-chain transactions such as liquidation and auctions. Arbitrageurs can also take advantage of price differences between DODO and other exchanges. \n\nLiquidity providers are not required to make a minimum deposit  and are not restricted on the type of asset they provide. LPs can create their own trading pairs, deposit their own tokens to negate price risk and also collect a portion of DODO transaction fees as rewards. \n\nDODO also attracts new crypto projects with a free listing as an Initial DODO Offering (IDO). Unlike AMM protocols, DODO does not require quote tokens, and IDO projects only need to deposit their own tokens to the liquidity pool, after which the PMM creates its own ask-side depth. To start an IDO, a project needs to only set the oracle price to a constant. Liquidity is improved by depositing more quote tokens. \n\n\n### **Related Pages**:\n\nLearn more about [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/)/\n\nLearn more about [Sushiswap (SUSHI)](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/). \n\nLearn more about [Curve (CRV).](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/)\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) for trending blockchain news and insights. \n\nCheck out CMC [impermanent loss calculator](https://coinmarketcap.com/yield-farming/).\n\n\n## How Many DODO (DODO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of the DODO token is 1 billion (1,000,000,000). There are currently 12 million coins in circulation. \n\nDODO’s total supply will be distributed as follows: \n\n\n\n*   15% to the core team/future hires/advisors\n*   16% to investors\n*   1% to initial liquidity provision (IDO)\n*   8% to operations/marketing/partnerships\n*   60% to community incentives\n\n\n## How Is the DODO Network Secured?\n\nDODO is a decentralized protocol and therefore resistant to centralized network attacks relying on a single point of failure. DODO’s smart contracts were audited by [PeckShield](https://peckshield.cn/en), a blockchain security company, on July 10 2020. Its audit report on DODO can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DODOEX/dodo-smart-contract/master/audit/dodo_audit_report_2020_16_en_1.0.pdf). \n\nPlease be aware that DeFi protocols are innovative and high-risk projects and therefore vulnerable to coding bugs and security issues that could be exploited by hackers and result in the loss of funds.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy DODO (DODO)?\n\nDODO can now be traded on the centralized exchanges [MXC.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [L Bank](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/) and [BiKi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/biki/), as well as [decentralized exchanges (DEX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) like [Uniswap V2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap/), [Mooniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mooniswap/) and [Dodo.](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/dodo/) You can find others listed on our [crypto exchanges page](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/).\n\nWant to purchase cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum directly by credit card in the fiat currency of your choice?

7226,Injective Protocol,injective-protocol,INJ,active,token,"## What Is Injective Protocol (INJ)?\n\nThe Injective Protocol project is a revolutionary idea that aims to make currency exchanges completely decentralized, public operated networks. What this means is the exchange is solely operated by people who hold INJ tokens. There is no centralized governing body that enforces control over the development of the project. The Injective Protocol project officially launched via a public offering in 2020, and it was backed by names in the industry like [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Pantera](https://www.panteracapital.com/) and [Hashed](https://www.hashed.com/).\n\nThe Injective Chain is the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) foundation of the project. It hosts a completely decentralized order book and employs elements from the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)). The platform also incorporates a bi-directional token bridge, linking it to the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) ecosystem.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Injective Protocol?\n\n[Eric Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericchenmelt/) is the co-founder of Injective Labs, the company behind INJ. He has a bachelor of science in finance from NYU Stern, and his professional career started back in 2014. Chen was a research fellow at Desay Sv Automotive, and later moved to AXA Advisors to become an analyst. In 2017, Eric Chen became a researcher for Innovating Capital, and a year later, in 2018, he co-founded Injective Protocol. \n\n[Albert Chon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertchon/) is the chief technical officer of Injective Protocol. He graduated with a computer science masters degree from Stanford University and became a full stack engineer for Linc Global in 2017. At the beginning of 2018, he started a position at Amazon as a software development engineer; however, he soon moved on to co-found Injective Protocol with Eric Chen. He has been with the company since its launch in mid-2018. \n\n\n#### What Makes Injective Protocol Unique?\n\nInjective Protocol is a noteworthy project because it aims to solve problems in the financial world by employing blockchain technology’s decentralized nature. INJ allows investors to participate in a genuinely decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi)) organization, where they have the power to make changes happen and introduce new ideas. \n\nThe Injective Chain blockchain is available for anyone to use, which is what makes it completely decentralized. It does not matter if you are a small-time investor or a big-time corporation; Injective Protocol offers the same level of influence and power to everyone. The blockchain allows you to trade a vast array of derivatives, CFDs and other forms of assets.\n\nWhile it introduces revolutionary technology to decentralize the world of exchanges and trading, Injective Protocol still operates on proven methods to make money. Makers and takers pay transaction fees in INJ, which allows the platform to continue working in a decentralized manner.  \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/).\n\nCheck out [Decred](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/).\n\nRead more about [Decentralization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized). \n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Injective Protocol (INJ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of Injective Protocol (INJ) tokens is 100,000,000. Currently, there are about 15,406,012 INJ tokens in circulation on the market. According to the official INJ [white paper](https://docs.injectiveprotocol.com/#token-economics), there is necessary inflation set to 7% at the launch of INJ tokens so that nodes are incentivized to validate transactions on the blockchain. This inflation rate is gradually going to decrease over time and reach 2%.\n\nThe way INJ tokens are distributed is based on aggregate profit-and-loss. In essence, the more INJ tokens you hold, the more you will receive when redistributions occur, as your wallet has a more significant weighted value. This ensures the decentralized nature of the exchange. \n\n\n### How Is the Injective Protocol Network Secured?\n\nThe Injective Protocol blockchain operates on a proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. This is one of the more prominent similarities INJ has with the Ethereum blockchain. To use the mechanism of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, INJ relies on PoS for security.\n\nProof-of-stake is an alternative consensus to the popular proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus used by [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). PoS has numerous advantages in terms of required power input for mining, scalability and usability. The consensus also plays an essential role in ensuring the decentralized manner of operation for the whole network.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Injective Protocol (INJ)?\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ) tokens are available on most major exchanges. [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) has the highest INJ/USD trading volume at $12,687,084. This is the most popular exchange for purchasing INJ.\n\nOther good options include [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/).

The first product built by Alpha Finance Lab is Alpha Lending, a decentralized lending protocol with algorithmically-adjusted interest rates. \n\nLeveraged yield-farming platform Alpha Homora was the second product launched by the platform, whereas AlphaX — a non-orderbook perpetual swap product — is scheduled to launch in 2021. \n\nALPHA is the native utility token of the platform. Token holders can earn a share of network fees by [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) ALPHA tokens to cover any default loans. Other use cases for the token include [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) mining and governance voting.\n\nAlpha Finance Lab will implement governance via a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) allowing ALPHA holders to vote on the specifics of future Alpha products, and decide how they interoperate. This governance procedure is split over two levels: product-level governance and finance-level governance, giving token holders a great deal of control over the future of Alpha. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Alpha Finance Lab?\n\nAlpha Finance Lab (ALPHA) launched in 2020, following a public token sale on the Binance Launchpad. \n\nThe platform was founded by Tascha Punyaneramitdee, Alpha Finance Labs' project lead and a former head of strategy at Band Protocol. Prior to her position at Alpha Finance Lab, Punyaneramitdee gained extensive experience working with global financial firms — most recently working as an investment banking analyst at Jefferies from 2017-2018, and product manager at technology giant Tencent from 2018 to 2020.  \n\nIn addition to Punyaneramitdee, the Alpha Finance Labs core team also includes lead engineer and blockchain researcher Nipun Pitimanaaree, a graduate in Mathematics and Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) four years in a row.\n\nIn total, the Alpha Finance Labs team consists of at least seven members, according to its official [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2268012647%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH). \n\n\n#### What Makes Alpha Finance Lab Unique?\n\nAlpha Finance Lab looks to differentiate itself from other DeFi ecosystems by actively seeking, identifying and addressing unmet needs in the DeFi space with a breakneck development cycle. \n\nUnlike other platforms, Alpha Finance Lab looks to ensure its solutions don’t just offer in-demand utility but are also user-friendly, helping to make DeFi more accessible. Each product developed by Alpha Finance Lab also acts to bolster the entire Alpha ecosystem, by providing additional utility for ALPHA token holders.\n\nAlpha Finance Lab’s first products each claim to bring an entirely new solution to the market. Alpha Homora is the first platform to introduce the leveraged yield farming concept and with the launch of Alpha Homora V2 in 2021, it will introduce the first smart contract that is capable of borrowing from another smart contract ([Cream Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cream-finance/)) in an under-collateralized way.\n\nMoreover, once launched, AlphaX will become the first Uniswap/Sushiswap-style perpetual swap decentralized exchange without order books. This will allow more individuals to access the benefits of perpetual swaps (such as trading on leverage), without having to understand how they work in the background. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nCheck out [Cream Finance (CREAM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cream-finance/) — a permissionless DeFi lending, swap, and payment platform.\n\nRead about [Polkastarter (POLS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkastarter/) — a Polkadot-based decentralized exchange.\n\nKeep up to date on the latest crypto lingo with the CoinMarketCap [Crypto Glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary).\n\nVisit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog) for the latest blockchain news and insights.\n\n\n#### How Many Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe ALPHA token was initially launched with a circulating supply of 174.1 million tokens out of a total of 1 billion ALPHA.\n\nAccording to Binance’s Alpha Finance Labs [research paper](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/alpha-finance-lab), the total supply of ALPHA tokens is allocated as follows:\n\n\n\n*   Binance Launchpad Sale: 10.00% of the total token supply\n*   Binance Launchpool: 5.00% of the total token supply\n*   Private Sale: 13.33% of the total token supply\n*   Liquidity Mining: 20.00% of the total token supply\n*   Team & Advisors: 15.00% of the total token supply\n*   Ecosystem: 36.67% of the total token supply\n\nTeam tokens are locked until August 2021 and will be fully vested by March 2024. \n\n\n### How Is the Alpha Finance Lab Network Secured?\n\nAs an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, ALPHA is backed by one of the most robust and secure blockchain networks in popular usage — [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). It is kept secure by its extensive [proof-of-work (POW)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mining network, which uses an army of dedicated miners to maintain the integrity of the network. \n\nAlthough Alpha Finance Labs has dedicated developers and researchers, it also relies on external audits to ensure its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) are secure. For example, Alpha Finance Labs has enlisted both PeckShield and Quantstamp to audit the smart contract code for Alpha Homora V2. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA)?\n\nAs of January 2021, the ALPHA token is listed on just a handful of exchange platforms — including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/). \n\nThere are currently no known fiat trading pairs for ALPHA, but you may be able to [buy Bitcoin (BTC) with fiat](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/), and then trade it for ALPHA on Binance. \n",,,"defi, yield-farming, binance-smart-chain, yield-aggregator, binance-launchpool, binance-launchpad, defiance-capital, alameda-research-portfolio, multicoin-capital-portfolio","DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain, Yield Aggregator, Binance Launchpool, Binance Launchpad, DeFiance Capital, Alameda Research Portfolio, Multicoin Capital Portfolio",https://alphafinance.io/,https://twitter.com/alphafinancelab,https://blog.alphafinance.io/,"https://t.me/AlphaFinanceLab, https://discord.com/invite/Z2vuKDT","https://bscscan.com/address/0xa1faa113cbe53436df28ff0aee54275c13b40975, https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1faa113cbe53436df28ff0aee54275c13b40975",,https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/alpha-lending-smart-contract/blob/master/documents/Alpha%20Lending%20Whitepaper.pdf,https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/alpha-lending-smart-contract/blob/master/documents/Alpha%20Lending%20Whitepaper.pdf,https://blog.alphafinance.io/,1839,2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,,True
7256,Mettalex,mettalex,MTLX,active,token,"## What is Mettalex?\n\nMettalex is a decentralised exchange that is focused on the trading of token-based commodities. Accessible 24/7 with tight trading spreads, low margin requirements and unique hedge instruments that ensure investors cannot be liquidated prior to settlement. \n\nIt allows access to traditional markets with minimal friction on taking positions and reduced requirements for margin. Mettalex combines the convenience of tokens with market sizes of the commodities world.\n\n## No liquidation\n\nStakeholders taking hedge positions assuming price hikes or dips will not lose their collateral on the basis of short term price movements. Position tokens remain valid the breach of floor or cap occurs.\n\n\n## Instant exit and settlements\n\nPositions on Mettalex are monitored by an autonomous agent that ensures the market has sufficient liquidity for selling your position in the event that you decide to exit.\n\n\n## Crowd-sourced collateral pool\n\nMettalex uses position tokens instead of margin positions offered by conventional trading platforms. These position tokens in turn are backed fully by collateral, adding another layer of stability to the exchange. \nMettalex is aiming to solve market failures inherent to today’s commodities market: front running, poor liquidity, price manipulation, and loss of value in the form of margin calls.\n\nMettalex solves this through the creation of what is referred to as position tokens. Position tokens are primarily used to track the difference in the price of an asset. They do not require the entirety of collateral of an asset to be tied up in a smart contract, thereby allowing contracts of much larger sizes to be traded with lower collateral requirements. This is also different from the conventional leverage requirements in traditional markets as the possibility of liquidation is not dependent on basis of the movement of prices until it hits a pre-set price band.\n\nThe anticipated first markets on the Mettalex platform will be:\n\n* Steel Supply chain based commodity spreads\n* Gold and Silver spreads with BTC and USD\n* Lithium and Oil Spreads with BTC and ETH\n* Stock Market indices spreads with BTC and ETH\n* Data Storage, Compute and Utilization spreads with USD/BTC/ETH\n",,,binance-smart-chain,Binance Smart Chain,https://mettalex.com/,https://twitter.com/Mettalex,"https://medium.com/fetch-ai/mettalex-economics-overview-f80c5c5a93a8, https://medium.com/fetch-ai/commodities-trading-made-easy-thanks-to-mettalexs-decentralized-platform-517eaca538de \r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/fetch-ai/mettalex-economics-overview-f80c5c5a93a8","https://t.me/mettalex_official, https://t.me/mettalex_official_news","https://etherscan.io/token/0x2e1e15c44ffe4df6a0cb7371cd00d5028e571d14, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2e1e15c44ffe4df6a0cb7371cd00d5028e571d14",,https://mettalex.com/wp-content/uploads/Mettalex-Litepaper_v1.0.pdf,https://github.com/fetchai/mettalex-token,https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-new-decentralized-exchange-lets-users-trade-commodity-and-crypto-derivatives,1027,2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,,True
7278,Aave,aave,AAVE,active,token,"## What Is Aave (AAVE)?\n\n** **\n\nAave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto.\n\n \n\nLenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity.\n\n \n\nAave (which means “ghost” in Finnish) was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding to Aave happened in September 2018. (This helps explain why this token’s ticker is so different from its name!)\n\n \n\nAAVE provides holders with discounted fees on the platform, and it also serves as a governance token — giving owners a say in the future development of the protocol.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Aave?\n\n** **\n\nAave, and its predecessor ETHLend, were founded by Stani Kulechov. At the time, he was frustrated at the lack of lending applications on Ethereum — and his project was built before [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) even existed.\n\n \n\nKulechov is a serial entrepreneur who went to law school and began programming when he was a teenager. He was an early adopter in the blockchain space. The CEO has said that he wanted to rebrand ETHLend as Aave so the company could offer a wider range of services beyond Ether lending.\n\n \n\nAccording to Kulechov, Aave’s main target market are people who are already engaged in the cryptocurrency community.\n\n\n## What Makes Aave Unique?\n\n** **\n\nAave has several unique selling points when compared with competitors in an increasingly crowded market. During the [DeFi craze](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) in the summer of 2020, it was one of the biggest projects in terms of the total value of crypto locked in its protocol.\n\n \n\nThe project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave’s flagship products are “flash loans,” which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There’s a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction.\n\n \n\nAnother big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.\n\n \n\n[Find out more about Compound (COMP) here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/)\n\n \n\n[Discover how Maker (MKR) tokens work](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/)\n\n \n\n[Learn about cryptocurrencies with CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/)\n\n \n\n[CoinMarketCap Blog: The latest news and features](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) \n\n\n### How Many AAVE (AAVE) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\n** **\n\nCirculation is linked to the total value locked on Aave, as tokens are burned whenever the protocol gathers fees.\n\n \n\nAn [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) was held in November 2017, where $16.2 million was raised by selling one billion AAVE tokens at a rate equivalent to $0.0162 a piece. At the time, 23% of AAVE tokens were assigned to its founders and project.\n\n \n\nAAVE tokens have been built based on the [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard, and they are designed to be deflationary. In the event of a shortfall in the DeFi protocol, staked tokens would be used as collateral as a last resort.\n\n \n\nIn July 2020, Aave unveiled plans to hold a token swap. This means that the 1.3 billion AAVE tokens in circulation would be swapped for the newly minted AAVE cryptocurrency at a ratio of 1:100, creating a total supply of 16 million AAVE. (Three million of this would be held in reserve.)\n\n\n### How Is the Aave Network Secured?\n\n** **\n\nAave’s open-source protocol is built on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0), a blockchain that is currently making the transition from [Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Aave (AAVE)?\n\n** **\n\nSome of the biggest exchanges that list AAVE tokens include CoinDCX, Binance, CoinBene and OKEx.

7288,Venus,venus,XVS,active,token,"## What Is Venus (XVS)?\r\n\r\nVenus is an algorithmic money market and synthetic stablecoin protocol launched exclusively on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). \r\n\r\nThe protocol introduces a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing solution to the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) ecosystem, enabling users to directly borrow against collateral at high speed while losing less to transaction fees. In addition, Venus allows users to mint VAI [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) on-demand within seconds by posting at least 200% collateral to the Venus smart contract. \r\n\r\nVAI tokens are synthetic BEP-20 token assets that are pegged to the value of one U.S. dollar (USD), whereas XVS tokens are also BEP-20-based, but are instead used for governance of the Venus protocol, and can be used to vote on adjustments—including adding new collateral types, changing parameters and organizing product improvements. \r\n\r\nThe governance of the protocol is entirely controlled by XVS community members, since the Venus founders, team members and other advisors do have any XVS token allocations. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Who Are the Founders of Venus (XVS)?\r\n\r\nThe development of the Venus project is being undertaken by the Swipe project team. The main goal of Venus is to achieve decentralization through community-governance. There are no pre-mines for the team, developers or founders, giving XVS holders total control over the path the Venus Protocol takes. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What Makes Venus (XVS) Unique?\r\n\r\nVenus’ main strength is its high speed and extremely low transaction costs, which are a direct result of being built on top of the Binance Smart Chain. The protocol is the first to enable users to access lending markets for [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) Litecoin ([LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/)) and other cryptocurrencies to source [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) in real-time, thanks to its near-instant transactions. \r\n\r\nCustomers sourcing liquidity using the Venus Protocol do not have to pass a credit check and can quickly take out a loan by interacting with the Venus decentralized application ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). Since there are no centralized authorities in place, users are not restricted by their geographic region, credit score or anything else, and can always source liquidity by posting sufficient collateral. \r\n\r\nThese loans are provided from a pool contributed by Venus users, who receive a variable APY for their contribution. These loans are secured by the over-collateralized deposits made by borrowers on the platform. \r\n\r\nTo avoid market manipulation [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack), the Venus Protocol utilizes price feed [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor), including those from [Chainlink](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) to provide accurate pricing data that cannot be tampered with. Thanks to the Binance Smart Chain, the protocol can access the price feeds at a lower cost and with better efficiency, reducing the overall cost footprint of the system.  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Related Pages**:\r\n\r\nRead about [Injective Protocol (INJ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective-protocol/) — a project that launched through the Binance Launchpad.\r\n\r\n \\\r\nRead about [Binance Coin (BNB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/) — the token that powers the Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nTake a [deep dive into decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) (DeFi) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\r\n\r\nBrowse the [CoinMarketCap Blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/) to discover the latest insights and market trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Many Venus (XVS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nVenus has a maximum total supply of 30 million XVS tokens, and just over 4.2 million XVS tokens were in circulation as of November 2020. \r\n\r\nVenus was one of the first platforms to conduct a Launchpool on Binance, which allowed users to farm XVS by staking different assets including Binance Coin (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD) and Swipe (SXP) tokens. A total of 20% of the total supply (6 million XVS) was allocated to the Binance Launchpool, and the token was listed shortly after on the Binance spot exchange platform. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe project had no pre-sale or private sale, and the team has no token allocation, but 1% of the total supply (300,000 XVS) is reserved for Binance Smart Chain ecosystem grants. The remaining 23.7 million XVS tokens will be gradually unlocked over a period of four years as they are mined by those that use the Venus protocol. \r\n\r\nAccording to the project [white paper](https://venus.io/Whitepaper.pdf), 35% of daily XVS rewards are distributed to borrowers, 35% to suppliers, and the remaining 30% to VAI stablecoin minters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How is the Venus (XVS) Network Secured?\r\n\r\nThe Venus network is secured by the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain that runs in parallel to the Binance Chain. BSC is compatible with the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) Virtual Machine (EVM) and is capable of running even if the Binance Chain goes offline or encounters issues. \r\n\r\nBinance Smart Chain utilizes a unique [consensus algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) known as proof-of-staked authority (POSA) to secure the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). This is essentially a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines aspects of both [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) and proof-of-authority (POA). It is built around a network of 21 validators who are responsible for executing tasks on the Binance Smart Chain, and reaching consensus about recently processed transactions. \r\n\r\nBeyond this, Venus suppliers are protected by automatic liquidation measures, which will automatically liquidate the collateral of borrowers if it falls below 75% of their borrowed amount—thereby reimbursing suppliers early to maintain the minimum collateralization ratio. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Where Can You Buy Venus (XVS)?\r\n\r\nAs of November 2020, Venus is available to trade on a single exchange platform: Binance. It is listed against Tether (USDT), [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD). There are currently no direct fiat on-ramps to purchase Venus.\r\n\r\nTo buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with your credit or debit card, check out our simple [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).",,,"defi, yield-farming, binance-smart-chain, binance-launchpool, lending-borowing","DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Launchpool, Lending / Borrowing",https://venus.io/,https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol,https://medium.com/venusprotocol,https://t.me/VenusProtocol,https://bscscan.com/token/0xcf6bb5389c92bdda8a3747ddb454cb7a64626c63,,https://venus.io/Whitepaper.pdf,https://github.com/SwipeWallet/Venus-Protocol,,1839,2020-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,,True
7311,Beefy.Finance,beefy-finance,BIFI,active,token,"## What Is Beefy.Finance (BIFI)? \n\nBeefy.Finance (BIFI), launched in 2020, is a yield optimization tool on the Binance Smart Chain that helps maximize the return from [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming). Yield farming is the practice of staking or lending your crypto assets to a smart contract-based liquidity pool in order to generate returns or rewards.\n\nThe lender is known as the liquidity provider and the fund where the money is kept is known as the liquidity pool. Yield farming protocols incentivize the liquidity providers (LPs) to lock up their crypto assets in the liquidity pool.\n\nThese incentives can take the form of percentages of transaction fees, governance tokens, or interest from the lenders. Yield optimization is the usage of data analysis tools to maximize the performance of yield farming projects. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Beefy.Finance?\n\nThe core team consists of pseudonymous developers known as @superbeefyboy, @sirbeefalot_bnb, @roastyb1 and @0xbeefy. Other people have contributed to the community by writing and testing strategies, tracking stats, creating marketing materials and developing new initiatives.\n\n\n#### What Makes Beefy.Finance Unique?\n\nBeefy.Finance optimizes yields through a vault system. These vaults serve as investment instruments and can implement strategies through the use of smart contracts. \n\nThe vaults can automate the best yield farming opportunities and can use crypto assets as liquidity, provide assets as collateral, manage collateral and reduce chances of liquidation and use assets to generate a yield and compound profits. This combination of features allows users to automate their DeFi farming and optimize the returns. There are vault updates that remove the need for decision-making from an independent yield farmer.\n\nBeefy.Finance has no deposit fee; however, there is a withdrawal fee of 0.01% of the withdrawal amount. \n\nThe performance fee on additional yield varies and is specified for each particular vault. There is also a call fee of 0.55% throughout each harvest. Beefy.Finance supports many popular wallets including Metamask, WalletConnect, TrustWallet and others.\n\nBeefy.Finance has its own governance token BIFI that allows users to receive a portion of the vault’s performance fees. BIFI holders can stake their tokens into a governance pool. It then distributes [WBNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wbnb/) daily to the stakers, based on their percentage of the pool. Users do not have to un-stake their tokens to participate in voting.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [EveryCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/everycoin/).\n\nLearn about [3x Short Bitcoin SV Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/3x-short-bitcoin-sv-token/).\n\nLearn about Polkadot on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot).\n\nLearn more about the world of cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Beefy.Finance (BIFI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAs of March 2021, Beefy.Finance (BIFI) has a circulating supply of 72,000 BIFI and a maximum supply of 80,000 BIFI coins.\n\n\n### How Is the Beefy.Finance Network Secured?\n\nBeefy.Finance has an allowance checker that allows users to identify projects and addresses that have an allowance to spend their tokens in. This tool also lets users revoke spending permissions for a small transaction fee. It ensures that no unwanted projects can drain funds from users’ wallets. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Beefy.Finance (BIFI)?\n\nBeefy.Finance (BIFI) can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [JulSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/julswap/)\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n\nMake sure to read our [guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) on how to buy Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) and other cryptocurrencies.\n",,,"defi, yield-farming, binance-smart-chain, yield-aggregator, governance","DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain, Yield Aggregator, Governance",https://beefy.finance/,https://twitter.com/beefyfinance,https://medium.com/beefyfinance,"https://t.me/beefyfinance, https://discord.gg/yq8wfHd",https://bscscan.com/token/0xCa3F508B8e4Dd382eE878A314789373D80A5190A,,,https://github.com/beefyfinance,,1839,2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,,True

7395,Atari Token,atari-token,ATRI,active,token,"## What Is Atari Token [ATRI]?\n\nAtari Token is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain. It was designed by Atari Chain Ltd. — a subsidiary of the video game and consumer electronics firm Atari Interactive — specifically for the needs of the interactive entertainment industry.\n\nAtari’s plan for its ATRI token is to become a universal means of payment for the video game industry, allowing developers and publishers new options for monetization of their products, integration of smart contracts, protection of in-game assets and more.\n\nATRI became available to the public on October 30, 2020. Prior to that, it underwent three private pre-sale rounds in March-April, September and October 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Atari Token?\n\nAtari Token was founded and is continuously developed by Atari Chain Limited, a subsidiary firm of Atari created specifically for this purpose.\n\nAtari itself is one of the earliest successful video game and arcade game companies, co-founded in California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Pong — the first commercially successful video game — was released by Atari in November 1972.\n\nThe company’s Atari 2600 video game console, released in 1977, was one of the first platforms to pioneer the use of ROM cartridges — as opposed to many other consoles at the time that only supported games that were in-built into each particular console.\n\nIn 2008, Atari became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infogrames Entertainment (IESA) — currently known as Atari SA — a French holding company specialized in video games and based in Paris.\n\n\n#### What Makes Atari Token Unique?\n\nAtari Token’s main target market is the interactive entertainment industry; with ATRI, Atari is aiming to create a decentralized, secure and permissionless means of transfer of value between individual players and/or video game platforms.\n\nAs of November 2020, Atari Chain Ltd. is developing its own network of smart platforms, video games and online casinos which will support deep integration with ATRI and enjoy the benefits associated with [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based decentralized cryptocurrencies. In the future, the firm plans to extend the option of ATRI integration to any platform or application in the video game industry.\n\nATRI is a fully decentralized token based on Ethereum’s [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) compatibility standard. This means that it can be easily integrated with the existing infrastructure of Ethereum, such as online exchanges and wallets, allowing for entirely new use cases in the video game industry.\n\nOne possible example offered by Atari Chain itself are skill-based video games that allow players to stake ATRI tokens against each other. In this scenario, the winner would take home the combined stake and be able to immediately convert it into a different cryptocurrency or a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar on any ERC-20 compatible exchange where ATRI is listed. \n\n\n##### **Related Pages**:\n\nRead more about [ENJ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/) — another project that aims to disrupt the video game industry through the use of crypto.\n\nCheck out CoinMarketCap’s new educational platform, CMC [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/crypto-basics).\n\n\n##### How Many Atari Token [ATRI] Coins Are There In Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of ATRI is limited to 7.481 billion tokens. The issuance, buyback and burning of ATRI tokens are managed by Atari Chain Ltd. in accordance with their policy that takes into account network growth, demand and usage.\n\nThe total supply of tokens will be distributed as follows:\n\n\n\n*   25% - Founder’s Strategic Basket — to be invested into platforms, token swaps, blockchain games and other ventures with the ultimate goal of growing Atari’s own network of ATRI-enabled smart platforms;\n*   20% - Ecosystem Development Fund — to be unlocked in monthly tranches over three years starting from the token’s launch;\n*   10% — Private sale and related bonuses;\n*   10% — Public sale and related bonuses;\n*   30% — To be released and unlocked in the future in accordance to network growth and demand rates.\n\n\n#### How Is the Atari Token Network Secured?\n\nATRI is an Ethereum-based token and is secured by its Ethash cryptographic algorithm.\n\n\n#### Where Can You Buy Atari Token [ATRI]?\n\nAs of November 2020, Atari Token is available on the [Bitcoin.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitcoin-com-exchange/) exchange and [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)",AtariChain,,"gambling, collectibles-nfts, gaming","Gambling, Collectibles & NFTs, Gaming",https://www.atarichain.com/,https://twitter.com/atari,,"https://t.me/AtariTokenOfficial, https://discord.gg/6Xzd5tw","https://etherscan.io/token/0xdacd69347de42babfaecd09dc88958378780fb62, https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdacd69347de42babfaecd09dc88958378780fb62",https://reddit.com/r/AtariChain,https://atarichain.com/documents/atari-one-pager.pdf,,,1027,2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,,True

7411,Covalent,covalent,CQT,active,token,"## What Is Covalent (CQT)?\n\n[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) leverages big-data technologies to create meaning from hundreds of billions of data points, delivering actionable insights to investors and allowing developers to allocate resources to higher-utility goals within their organization.\n\nInstead of painstakingly sourcing data from a small handful of chains, Covalent aggregates information from across dozens of sources including nodes, chains and data feeds. The Covalent API then sources end-users with individualized data by wallet, including current and historical investment performance across all types of digital assets. Most importantly, Covalent returns this data in a rapid and consistent manner, incorporating all relevant data within one API interface.\n\nHaving achieved product-market fit, we are now planning to execute the next phase of Covalent, which is a progressive decentralization that will enable the Covalent Network to be owned and operated by its users. Of course, a critical piece to this is CQT.\n\nCQT is the native token of the Covalent Network. It has three primary purposes:\n\n-   CQT is a governance token, whereby token holders vote on proposals to change the system parameters.\n\n-   CQT is a staking asset. Validators will earn fees for answering queries.\n\n-   CQT is a network access token that fulfills data queries for users of the API.\n\nDeveloper resources include:\n\n* [Covalent Knowledge Base](<https://www.covalenthq.com/docs>) for extensive guides on how to use the Covalent API.\xa0\n\n* [Covalent API Documentation](<https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/>).\n\n### Covalent Use Cases\n\nCovalent Use Cases\n\nThe bulk of the use-cases are as-of-yet unknown, and we are constantly surprised at the multitude of ways developers and our partners use the data.\n\n* **Taxes**: Every single DeFi action is a taxable event and having access to this data helps firms be compliant. If a trader uses Coinbase, they can quickly download a CSV of their trade data - besides Covalent, there is no such thing for a decentralized exchange like Uniswap or 1inch.\\\n* **DeFi**: DeFi protocols, such 0x and Zerion to name a few, use the Covalent API to pull real-time, granular blockchain data. What makes the Covalent API such a critical infrastructure piece for these projects is that not only can they pull wallet specific data, but they expand their service to display data across multiple chains. This significantly enhances their product offering and fundamentally improves the user experience.\n\nIn the case of Zerion, the exact data the DeFi investment dashboard is pulling ranges across multiple chains including Polygon, BSC and Ethereum and includes transactional data, as well a user's token balances, and transaction history.\n\n* **NFTs**: As the popularity of NFTs has boomed over the past number of months, it has become increasingly important for NFT projects to be able to provide a means of analysis. Given that the Covalent API provides such, Covalent has become the leading NFT data provider. NFT projects such as ChainGuardains and Ethermon are now using the Covalent API to not only power novel features specific to each project, but to again improve the user experience.\n\n* **DAOs**: Reliable and real-time data are critical in making informed decisions, facilitating governance and allowing individuals to invest, consume, and participate in the DAO phenomenon. It should come as no surprise then that DAOs are using the Covalent API. Individuals can use the API to view and examine proposal interactions so that one can understand how active members are in creating proposals and voting on them as well as if members are voting for, or against proposals in general.\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Covalent?\n\nCovalent is built by an experienced team of data scientists and blockchain and database engineers passionate about improving and scaling blockchain technologies. Ganesh Swami, CEO and Co-founder, is a physicist by training and started his career designing algorithms for cancer drugs in the pharmaceutical space. His first company is listed on the NYSE. Levi Aul, CTO and Co-founder, built one of the first Bitcoin exchanges in Canada and was part of the team that built CouchDB at IBM.\n\nMore information about the team can be found at[  https://www.covalenthq.com/about/](https://www.covalenthq.com/about/)\n\n### Where Can I Buy Covalent's Query Token (CQT)?\n\nCQT is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with cryptocurrency and [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) pairs currently available.\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

7463,RAMP,ramp,RAMP,active,token,"## What Is RAMP (RAMP)?\n\nRAMP [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)  is a decentralized protocol that intends to boost DeFi adoption by allowing non-Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) users to stake tokens on ETH platforms; at the same time, Ethereum users can interact with the RAMP protocol and increase their yields. \n\nRAMP DeFi allows the staked capital of non-[ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/erc20/) staking blockchains to be collateralized into a stablecoin known as rUSD that is issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The main result of this is the maximization of capital efficiency on stacked digital assets, where users earn staking rewards, unlock liquidity from staked assets and stack multiple yield streams at the same time. \n\nUsers who are already on the Ethereum blockchain can mint eUSD by depositing their ERC20 stablecoins into RAMP’s eUSD liquidity pool. This means that rUSD and eUSD holders can exchange, lend or borrow both tokens freely and in turn create liquidity for users with capital locked into staking arrangements. \n\nRAMP’s creation was prompted by the rapid growth of the staking economy, which has exceeded $300 billion by 2021, combined with the inefficiency of said economy’s markets.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of RAMP?\n\nRAMP was co-founded by Lawrence Lim and Loh Zheng Rong. Before RAMP, Lim was the head of international growth at IOST and handled global sales at TradeGecko. He was also responsible for mergers and acquisitions at KPMG Corporate Finance LLC and asset management at JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nLim studied at the Nanyang Technological University and got a bachelor of business degree in banking and finance with First Class Honors.\n\nLoh Zheng Rong co-founded NOX Pte Ltd and was a blockchain consulting partner at Merkle Ventures LLP. He was also the chief innovation officer at 2359 media, as well as the senior advisor of ICONIC Partners. He was also the chief operating officer and co-founder of Toucanapp Pte Ltd. He has a bachelor of business administration (B.B.A) degree in finance wealth management from the Singapore Management University.\n\n\n### What Makes RAMP Unique?\n\nTo efficiently power token exchanges between blockchain systems, the network takes advantage of liquidity on/off-ramp designs. Within this framework, the tokens that use a non-Ethereum standard are first converted into stablecoins called rUSD for use on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n[ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20)-based stablecoins can also be converted into eUSD for use in Ramp DeFi’s liquidity pool. rUSD holders get the ability to use funds locked in non-Ethereum blockchains as well as the ability to use fully-collateralized stablecoins and earn staking incentives after the conversion. eUSD holders earn interest from lending their digital wealth as well as a chance to provide liquidity within DeFi protocols. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Quant](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quant/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn about [Akropolis](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/akropolis/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn about Mimblewimble on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mimblewimble)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nEnter the world of crypto through the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\n\n### How Many RAMP (RAMP) Coins Are There in Circulation? \n\nRAMP’s circulating supply is around 176 million coins as of February 2021, with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 RAMP coins.\n\n\n### How Is the RAMP Network Secured?\n\nRAMP network collaborates with the Crust Network for secure on-chain decentralized data storage. As such, RAMP DeFi is an open finance project and has the potential to unlock liquidity from staked digital assets, allowing all users to collateralize their digital assets while locked in staking into liquid capital. \n\nCrust implements the incentive layer protocol for decentralized storage. It is adaptable to multiple storage layer protocols, including IPFS, and even supports the application layer. The architecture it is based on has the capability to support a decentralized computing layer and build an entire cloud ecosystem.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy RAMP (RAMP)?\n\nRAMP is available to buy, sell and trade on the following exchanges:\n\n[Bibox](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bibox/)\n\n[Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/)\n\n[Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/)\n\n[Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)\n\n[MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/)\n\nUnfamiliar with crypto purchasing?

7617,saffron.finance,saffron-finance,SFI,active,token,"### A standard for tokenizing on-chain collateral\r\nSaffron is a protocol for tokenizing on-chain assets, including contracts that otherwise impair access to utilized capital. Tokenized ownership of on-chain assets gives liquidity providers greater flexibility and uninterrupted access to their underlying collateral while enabling leveraged staking and bespoke risk management.\r\n\r\n### Peer to peer risk exchange\r\nExisting decentralized earning platforms expose liquidity providers to complex code driven outcomes. Network participants must evaluate an array of catastrophic scenarios where the resulting state could wipe out their holdings or lead to significant impermanent loss. It is hard to anticipate the net effect of extreme market volatility or focused economic attacks. Saffron narrows the set of possible outcomes by giving liquidity providers dynamic exposure.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic exposure\r\nThe first application of Saffron gives liquidity providers the option to select customized risk and return profiles via the use of Saffron pool tranches. Saffron separately tokenizes the future earning stream and the net present value of utilized principal in each tranche. Earnings, based on tokenized holdings, are distributed accordingly across all tranches via payback waterfalls.\r\n\r\n### Payback waterfall\r\nThe initial application of the payback waterfall is split between two primary tranches.\r\n-A yield enhanced “A” tranche.\r\n-A risk mitigated super-senior “AA” tranche.\r\n\r\nAdded liquidity, when removed, is used to pay back the initial principal of AA holders before paying the principal and interest of the yield enhanced A tranche. In exchange for this enhanced return, participants of the A tranche must stake Saffron’s native tokens (SFI) to mitigate against failures on the underlying platform (such as Compound, Aave, or Curve). The Saffron protocol in this scenario acts as an escrow service for transfer of risk between A tranche participants and AA tranche participants. Saffron also includes an “S” tranche for allocating liquidity efficiently as it is needed based on a tranche balancing algorithm.",,,"defi, yield-farming, binance-smart-chain, yield-aggregator, coinbase-ventures-portfolio, ledgerprime-portfolio, multicoin-capital-portfolio","DeFi, Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain, Yield Aggregator, Coinbase Ventures Portfolio, LedgerPrime Portfolio, Multicoin Capital Portfolio",https://saffron.finance/,https://twitter.com/saffronfinance_,https://medium.com/saffron-finance,"https://discord.gg/pDXpXKY, https://t.me/saffronfinance","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb753428af26e81097e7fd17f40c88aaa3e04902c, https://ftmscan.com/token/0x924828a9Fb17d47D0eb64b57271D10706699Ff11",,,https://github.com/saffron-finance/saffron,,1027,2020-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,,True

7672,Unifi Protocol DAO,unifi-protocol-dao,UNFI,active,token,"## What Is Unifi Protocol DAO (UNFI)?\n\nUnifi Protocol DAO is a revolutionary approach to decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi)). Launched in 2020, the network aims to bring modern technology to the financial world. By employing the innate security and decentralization features of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology, and the automation of [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), Unifi Protocol DAO offers users the ability to develop DeFi solutions for their enterprise. \n\nThis project combines the power of several blockchains and relies on the foundation of Ethereum [DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and DeFi development. However, Unifi makes it its mission to introduce interoperability to the world of DeFi by allowing users access to multiple blockchains and an extremely versatile UNFI token. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Unifi Protocol DAO?\n\nThe Unifi Protocol DAO was founded and created by an online staking community called Sesameseed. [Juliun Brabon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliun/) is co-founder and CEO of Sesameseed and plays an invaluable role in creating Unifi Protocol DAO. He graduated with an English degree from the University of Buffalo and started a career in operations management. Later he became the president of several companies, including Jarrow Industries and Dr. Vita. In May 2018, he co-founded Sesameseed and started working on Unifi Protocol DAO.\n\n[Kerk Wei Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-yang-kerk-3ab4a7ba/) is another integral part of the Sesameseed team, responsible for developing the smart contract capabilities of Unifi Protocol DAO. He graduated from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and started working in data administration. He joined Sesameseed in October 2020. \n\n[Daniel Blanco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-blanco-parla-5aa8a424/) is the lead developer of Unifi Protocol DAO. He has a solid background in information technologies and has worked for companies like Transparent CDN and Seedtag. Since 2020, he is also the lead tech advisor for Sesameseed.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Unifi Protocol DAO Unique?\n\nAiming to give traders access to simple, fast, and efficient cross-chain activity, Unifi is a comprehensive DeFi solution for enterprises of all sizes. The platform also has a rigid rewards program, allowing investors and traders to gain staking value for holding UNFI tokens. \n\nIn the official [white paper](https://unifiprotocol.com/litepaper/), the founding team details an impressive development path for the project. In 2021, the company will aim to bring additional capabilities to the protocol and introduce the uLend platform, which will allow users to participate in peer-to-peer lending of UNFI tokens. \n\nNot only that, Unifi Protocol DAO has attracted investments from prominent names in the cryptocurrency sector, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [HBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hbtc/) and [Chain Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chain-capital/).\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [Monero](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/).\n\nFind out more about [THETA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta/).\n\nLearn more about [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao).\n\nHave a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Unifi Protocol DAO (UNFI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe total supply of UNFI tokens is 10,000,000. Currently, there are about 2,856,577 UNFI tokens in active circulation on the market. \n\nOver half of the total UNFI token supply is dedicated to a Liquidity Providers and Ecosystem Development (LPED) fund. Of the remaining tokens, 15% were distributed as rewards for the founding team and other vital developers. Another 12% were distributed among investors during a private sale. More than 10% of UNFI tokens were set aside for Ecosystem Support, while another 6.5% were released during a Seed Sale for interested investors. Lastly, 5% of the total supply was dedicated to Pool Mining activities, designed to support public token allocation. \n\n\n### How Is the Unifi Protocol DAO Network Secured?\n\nUnifi Protocol DAO is a combination of blockchains and smart contracts secured by a proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. PoS relies on the fact that tokens are stakable to ensure the validity of nodes and secure the mining process. This means that nodes are selected based on their stake in the given token. \n\nUnlike the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus method used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, PoS is extremely scalable and can offer more flexibility to project creators. Not only that, PoS does not require vast amounts of electrical and computing power to facilitate the mining process.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Unifi Protocol DAO (UNFI)?\n\nUNFI tokens are becoming relatively popular, which means that more exchanges have started offering them. If you are looking to invest in UNFI, one option is [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), as it has the largest trading volume of UNFI/USD, $6,537,400.\n\nOther options for trading UNFI include [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/) and [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/). Keep in mind that trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk, just like any other investment. \n\n[Find out more](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about crypto trading.\n",,,"defi, binance-smart-chain, binance-launchpool","DeFi, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Launchpool",https://www.unifiprotocol.com/,https://twitter.com/unifiprotocol,https://medium.com/unifiprotocol/,https://t.me/unifiprotocol,"https://bscscan.com/address/0x728C5baC3C3e370E372Fc4671f9ef6916b814d8B, https://etherscan.io/token/0x441761326490cacf7af299725b6292597ee822c2, https://ethplorer.io/address/0x441761326490cacf7af299725b6292597ee822c2",,https://medium.com/unifiprotocol/introducing-the-unifi-protocol-2ad67bc8435,,,1839,2020-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,,True

The noninflationary ETHY, an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, can be staked to generate returns. Those who stake on the platform are rewarded with the profits from transaction fees, and periodic token buybacks will redistribute ETHY to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider).\n\nEthereum Yield was both [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ethereum-yield-ethy-ready-to-launch-in-defi-zone) and [launched](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1331035887078141953) in November 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ethereum Yield?\n\nThe development team behind Ethereum Yield has remained largely anonymous, although one developer publicly [identified](https://medium.com/realsatoshiclub/ethereum-yield-x-satoshiclub-ama-from-19-november-e8fbf91ba640) himself as Liao Fu during an ""ask me anything"" session. During the Q&A, Fu stated that the team will be working with majority ETHY holders to jointly govern the project.\n\n\n#### What Makes Ethereum Yield Unique?\n\nEthereum Yield has referred to itself as ""Ethereum's powerful Yield farming coin,"" stating that it's designed to maximize returns, reward holders and punish ""weak hands."" According to its announcement, when users stake [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) liquidity provider tokens, a percentage of incurred fees are used for price-pumping actions such as liquidating LP tokens and buying back ETHY. The project designed ETHY to be noninflationary, so every time a token is transferred, a fee is charged and awarded to the farmers.\n\nThe project relies on [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool), called EVaults, that execute strategies on deposited tokens and are [designed](https://docs.ethereumyield.farm/evaults.html) to maintain the value of ETHY and maximize returns for liquidity providers.\n\nIn December 2020, Ethereum Yield [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ethereum-stake-ready-to-launch-in-defi-zone-eth2-validator) that it would be launching [Ethereum Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-stake/) (ETHS), which will enable more advanced staking such as [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) validator [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking).

There is no built-in mechanism to mint new tokens beyond this amount. The supply was [allocated](https://medium.com/realsatoshiclub/ethereum-yield-x-satoshiclub-ama-from-19-november-e8fbf91ba640) in the following manner: 100,000 ETHY (20%) for a public presale, 375,000 ETHY (75%) for farming rewards and 25,000 (5%) ETHY for the development team.\n\nIn November 2020, the project [held](https://docs.ethereumyield.farm/presale.html) its token presale during which 100,000 ETHY was available for purchase, [locking in](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1330668759611273216) around $1 million in [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) on Uniswap.

It later [said](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1336860061788991490) that it had burned a total of 9,000 ETHY.\n\n\n### How Is the Ethereum Yield Network Secured?\n\nEthereum Yield is an ERC-20 token, which means that it relies on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) to validate ETHY transactions. Ethereum uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.\n\nThe project was launched with centralized governance, but it has stated ETHY token holders will be able to participate in governance and make decisions regarding developer fees, liquidity pools, etc. Despite its centralization, the project has [stated](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1333804824111026176) that its liquidity pools cannot be exploited by the development team because its liquidity is indefinitely locked up in Uniswap. In addition, the team has [renounced](https://twitter.com/EthereumYield/status/1332419424922578945) ownership over the staking [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nEthereum Yield's smart contracts were [audited](https://certik.foundation/vendors/ethereum%20yield) by blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK in November 2020.

A staking platform will govern the heart of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Vanilla Network relies on fundamental economics to produce an equilibrium price, being demand and supply. This is where the Vanilla Network differ from other platforms; the focus is on generating demand whilst the supply will continue to burn on a transactional basis. The Vanilla Network will be releasing on a periodic basis revolutionary staking and betting dApps that can be used and will appeal to all therefore, generating consumer demand.\n\nAt the heart of this is the “community fund” also known as the DAO, decentralized autonomous organization in computer programming. This fund will self-cycle, being funded and replenished by wins and losses in the betting dApps. This is much like the ‘house’ in a casino however; all of these funds belong to the community and not the owners of the casino.\n\nUltimately, the aim being to decentralize the betting exchange platform. There should be no losers, all margins are returned to holders of the Vanilla token if they continue to stake.\n\n\n## What betting dApps will be ‘Revolutionary’?\n\n\nThe Vanilla Option staking pool is simple to understand but extremely effective. All stakeholders in this option will routinely receive rewards based on transactions in the ecosystem. This equates to a huge 2.5% per transaction (the token burns at 5% per transaction, meaning 50% is returned to stakeholders with 2.5% of supply burned from the entire ecosystem).\n\nIn order to generate transactional demand, will be the following betting dApps.\n\n(1)   Head to Head bets. Community members can initiate a specific event (such as LA Lakers vs. Miami Heat, in the NBA) which will generate a smart contract to allow participants to choose a particular outcome. Based on the level engagement the odds will auto generate. The winner will then be approved, and receive tokens in line with the final outcome.\n\n(2)   Double of nothing rewards. Never done before in the Blockchain, this will allow users to attempt to double their rewards by using randomization on the Blockchain. A user does not have to participate in this option, but free tokens making more free tokens is an opportunity that does not come by on a daily basis.\n\n(3)   Blackjack, community poker, lotto and many more! The Vanilla Network will continue to build and bring these crowd pleasers to the Blockchain.\n\n\n## What are the token economics?\n\n\nMax Supply: 1,000,000 burns to 100,000 VANILLA\nBurn per transaction : 5%\nRewards per transaction returned to stakeholders: 2.5%\n\n\n## Where to Buy?\n\n\nCurrently the Vanilla Network token is available to buy on Uniswap and the WhiteBit exchange.

7791,Pancake Bunny,pancakebunny,BUNNY,active,token,"## What Is PancakeBunny (BUNNY)?\n\nPancakeBunny is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) yield aggregator and optimizer for the Binance Smart Chan and Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)), which is used for PancakeSwap ([CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/)). The PancakeBunny protocol gives farmers the opportunity to multiply their tokens.\n\nFarmers at PancakeBunny get permission from private individuals for automatic summation and reinvestment of yield on their behalf through mono-contracts. Users can farm on their own, but doing so involves a complex process of determining the optimal frequency and time at which to increase and reinvest profitability. With PancakeBunny users can delegate this process. The actual farming takes place on PancakeSwap. \n\nThe primary goal of the platform is to support the DeFi ecosystem by providing users with an easy way to automatically increase their profitability on Binance Smart Chain. The DeFi industry — especially yield aggregators — experienced a major surge of activity in 2020.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of PancakeBunny?\n\nPancakeBunny is being built by a group of anonymous developers who claim that their “code [speaks] for itself.”\n\nPancakeBunny is developed in cooperation with [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/).\n\n\n#### What Makes PancakeBunny (BUNNY) Unique?\n\nOwners of BUNNY tokens control the ecosystem of PancakeBunny and receive most of the profits from farming rewards. BUNNY holders place their tokens in the management pool to claim the profit, which is sent to the pool in the form of Binance Coin ([BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/)) rewards. The share of profit received by a participant is proportionate to the size of their BUNNY stake: the more tokens you stake, the higher your impact on the ecosystem.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about the [PancakeSwap exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/).\n\nLearn more about [Harvest Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/).\n\nFind out more about DeFi at [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/should-i-invest-in-defi).\n\nExpand your knowledge of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many PancakeBunny (BUNNY) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe BUNNY token doesn’t have a maximum supply. Instead, for 1 BNB earned in performance fees, 5 new BUNNY are minted via a smart contract. There is a maximum supply of 1,000,000 tokens; no circulating supply data is available as of March 2021.\n\nThe token’s fee structure is as follows: 30% is allocated as a performance fee for the processing of BUNNY transactions and 0.5% is charged as a withdrawal fee if the withdrawal takes place within 72 hours of deposit. \n\nThe 30% performance fee is given to the BUNNY stakers. For as long as the price of BUNNY is above 1BNB/10, participants are making money via the performance fee system. Ultimately, all fees are used as rewards for staking BUNNY — an approach that is expected to ensure the sustainability and longevity of PancakeBunny.\n\n\n### How Is the PancakeBunny Network Secured?\n\nThe PancakeBunny code has been audited by Haechi Labs, a smart contract auditing firm headquartered in South Korea.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy PancakeBunny (BUNNY)?\n\nBUNNY tokens can be traded on the [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/) decentralized exchange.\n\nFirst time buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?

7821,Royale Finance,royale-finance,ROYA,active,token,"## What Is Royale Finance (ROYA)?\n\nRoyale Finance is a cross-chain liquidity and technology solution for iGaming startups which leverages decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) capabilities. \n\nIt aims to combine DeFi with iGaming, essentially addressing security and trust loopholes in online gaming while making it easier for game developers to access liquidity.\n\nAfter launching its proof-of-concept in Q2 2020, Royale Finance began full development of its new platform, built on Web 3.0, and moved to funding and the release of its in-house token, ROYA. \n\nAs of January 2021, Royale Finance is in the final stages of its multiphase token sale, and has just secured funding from several investors worth $1.45 million prior to the release of its V1 app.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Royale Finance?\n\nRoyale Finance has some well-known gaming industry figures at the helm. Its CEO is Georgio Andrews, previously involved in building infrastructure for iGaming and blockchain industry entities. His background in fact lies in sports medicine and athletics, pivoting to cryptocurrency in 2016.\n\nCOO and co-founder Matt Armstrong comes from an engineering circle, swapping to cryptocurrency full time before collaborating with Andrews in 2017. He has been investing in cryptocurrency projects since 2016.\n\nCSO Avron Goss meanwhile has a solid 25 years of online gaming experience, becoming increasingly involved in provably fair technology with the rise of blockchain. He has also branched out into other subdivisions of the blockchain realm, assisting in the product launch of a tokenized stock exchange.\n\n\n#### What Makes Royale Finance Unique?\n\nAccording to its founders, iGaming as an industry still faces a problem when it comes to trust despite the emergence of blockchain technology in recent years. Additionally, liquidity access for game developers is an issue which is ripe for disruption using DeFi, they argue.\n\nAs such, Royale Finance aims to bridge the gap between what DeFi and iGaming can offer, helping the industry’s image while opening up profit potential to investors.\n\nDeFi is used for liquidity provision, and investors are incentivized to contribute funds and hold in-house token ROYA, thus helping projects using the Royale Finance platform.\n\nThe net effect is a near total reduction in centralized infrastructure, something which has plagued the acceptance and growth of online gaming in its infancy. Growth potential, Royale Finance notes, includes an iGaming industry value of $127 billion by 2027.\n\nROYA meanwhile also helps to generate income for the project, with a token sale seeing heavy oversubscription and a separate investment round raising almost $150 million.  \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about Enjin Coin (ENJ) [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/).\n\nRead more about FunFair (FUN) [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/funfair/).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

ROYA is a fixed cap ERC-20 token on Ethereum with a total supply of 72,000,000 tokens.\n\nROYA forms the basis by which the Royale Finance platform is funded and maintains liquidity. \n\nA complex ecosystem will use the funds derived from the ROYA token sale, which itself has a maximum cap of $1,450,000. According to Royale Finance’s official documentation, liquidity provision will take 20% of initial funding, with team operations, the umbrella outfit Royale Foundation and expansion of partnerships and the project ecosystem each being awarded 15%.\n\nDepending on the phase of the token sale, some allocations are subject to a vesting schedule. \n\nFor those staking ROYA, there are also various lockups involved, adherence to which increases the passive income derived from liquidity provision. \n\n\n### How Is the Royale Finance Network Secured?\n\nRoyale Finance uses [delegated proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos) (dPOS) as part of its security mechanism, while lockups aim to reduce the likelihood of mass liquidity drainage and other profiteering activities by investors.\n\nAs with any DeFi token, the risk of considerable initial volatility remains, and those looking to contribute liquidity should conduct thorough research into the associated risks, including the ultimate profitability from long-term staking.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Royale Finance (ROYA)?\n\nAs of January 2021, ROYA is still in its initial token sale stage, but has a small number of markets, with exchanges Bithumb and Bilaxy providing the lion’s share of trading volume.\n\nTrading pairs are available against [Bitcoin ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)(BTC), [Ether ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)(ETH), [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) and more, with the number of trading venues set to increase in time. \n\nStill a crypto newbie?

7824,Vai,vai,VAI,active,token,"## What Is Vai (VAI)?\n\nVai is a decentralized stablecoin built on the Venus Protocol that runs on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nVenus Protocol, launched in 2019, is governed by the XVS token. The latter was designed to be a fair launch cryptocurrency with no preliminary allocation to the project’s founders or its team. It can be earned through Binance Launchpool by providing liquidity to the protocol.\n\nVai, powered by the Venus Protocol, claims to be the first decentralized stablecoin on the Binance Smart Chain that is backed by a basket of stablecoins and other crypto assets without centralized control. Being powered by Binance Smart Chain allows Vai to offer its users a high-speed, low-fee money market.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Vai?\n\nXVS is distributed via a fair-launch mechanism with no founder and team allocations. It is backed by a well-funded organization Swipe, a Binance portfolio company. Swipe was founded by Joselito Lizarondo, who is also the company’s current CEO.\n\n\n#### What Makes Vai Unique?\n\nThe Venus protocol is governed by its native token XVS which can be mined by liquidity suppliers, protocol borrowers and stablecoin miners. \n\nThe protocol itself introduces an easy-to-use crypto-asset lending and borrowing solution to the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) ecosystem. It enables users to directly borrow against collateral at higher speed and lower transaction fees. Venus also allows users to mint the VAI stablecoin on demand by depositing at least 200% collateral onto the Venus smart contract.\n\nThe people who source liquidity through the Venus Protocol do not have to pass credit checks and can take out a loan by interacting with the Venus decentralized application ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). Due to the fact that it is not governed by a central authority, Venus users are not subjected to arbitrary restrictions and can always source desired liquidity by posting sufficient collateral.\n\nThe loans are then provided from a pool that is contributed by the Venus users, who can, in turn, receive an annual percentage yield (APY) for their contributions. The Venus Protocol also utilizes price feed oracles that provide accurate pricing data.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Qtum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qtum/).\n\nLearn more about [Digital Money Bits](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/digital-money-bits/).\n\nLearn about the difference between Uniswap and PancakeSwap on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/uniswap-vs-pancakeswap).\n\nStay in the loop on all things crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Vai (VAI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nVai (VAI) has a circulating supply of 160,567,211 tokens and a total supply of 160,704,318 as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Vai Network Secured?\n\nThe Vai network is fully secured by the Binance Smart Chain.

7831,Narwhalswap,narwhalswap,NAR,active,token,"## What Is Narwhalswap (NAR)?\n\nNarwhalswap is a decentralized exchange and yield farming protocol created with the aim of making the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) ecosystem faster and cheaper. It was launched in September 2020 and is based on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)), a second-layer protocol with high performance and low transaction fees.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Narwhalswap?\n\nNarwhalswap is developed by an anonymous team of experts in finance and blockchain technology.\n\n\n#### What Makes Narwhalswap (NAR) Unique?\n\nNarwhalswap’s goal is to solve common problems associated with the DeFi market. It assists other projects in creating their own tokens and performing their own swaps on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nNarwhalswap protocol will allow staking tokens from other projects, providing the trader with NLP tokens in return. NLP, in turn, can be used to earn NAR tokens. Another token, rNLP, can be used to mine liquidity in other projects on the BSC network.\n\nFor stability, Narwhalswap has created an optimization protocol that enables liquidity mining that takes full advantage of other BSC projects, helping maintain high liquidity in the long run.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [xDai](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xdai/).\n\nRead more about [YFDAI.FINANCE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yfdai-finance/).\n\n\n# Find out more about yield farming at [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming).\n\nExpand your knowledge of crypto by visiting the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Narwhalswap (NAR) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe Narwhalswap ecosystem is managed via the NAR governance token, which can be mined by providing liquidity to the exchange. In the future, holders of the NAR token will be able to participate in community decisions and receive dividends.\n\nAny changes in platform policy will be jointly voted on. The participants’ voting power is independent of their stake size: every holder enjoys only one vote. Holders of NAR tokens also have access to dividend payouts that do depend on the number of tokens they stake.\n\nThe liquidity extraction model will be completely different from the existing models that track the reliability of the Narwhalswap DeFi structure. The total supply of NAR tokens is 21,000,000, 80% of which will be distributed through liquidity mining. This incentivizes farmers to maintain liquidity as supply becomes more scarce over time.\n\n10% of mining rewards will be directed to the dividend pool and distributed among NAR holders. For each transaction with the NAR token, a 5% fee is deducted. Of that, 2.5% is burned and the remaining 2.5% is transferred to the dividend pool.\n\n\n### How Is the Narwhalswap Network Secured?\n\nNarwhalswap is based on Binance Smart Chain, an autonomous smart-contract-enabled highly secure blockchain. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)) and is planned to support all existing Ethereum instruments.\n\nBuilt-in dual-chain interoperability will enable inter-blockchain communication and scalable decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) that are expected to provide a fast and reliable user experience.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Narwhalswap (NAR)?\n\nNarwhalswap (NAR) can be traded on the [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/) decentralized exchange.\n\nWanna learn more about buying Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) and other cryptocurrencies?

7844,ACryptoS,acryptos,ACS,active,token,"## What Is ACryptoS (ACS)?\n\nACryptoS is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) product that runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and utilizes complex crypto strategies. The two primary ACryptoS products are yield optimizers, also called the ACryptoS Vaults, and a stablecoin decentralized exchange, ACryptoS StableSwap.\n\nThe yield optimizers help users maximize profits through vaults that use advanced yield farming techniques. These techniques are automated to help farmers grow their assets in a more efficient and fast manner.\n\nACryptoS Vaults are investment tools that execute strategies via smart contracts. The vaults make use of assets deposited by the users to perform tasks such as providing liquidity and collateralization, generating yields and compounding interests. Although the vault runs on the BSC, it is a fork of the Ethereum-based yearn.finance ([YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)).\n\nACryptoS Vaults employ some features of the farming mechanism of [SushiSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/). Some of the most popular vaults offered by ACryptoS are ACS/ACSI and Venus token vaults. Users who provide ACS and ACSI to the vaults can earn higher yields through a programmed yield farming mechanism. \n\nACryptoS StableSwap is an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) that allows for fast stablecoin trading on the BSC. StableSwap allows for trading with less slippage and lower fees. \n\n\n#### What Makes ACryptoS Unique?\n\nACryptoS is built to encourage long-term staking. Stakers who hold the ACS and ACSI tokens for prolonged periods of time are rewarded. When users make deposits to the vault, they can earn compound interest in an automated manner. The vaults employ programmed strategies that help users grow their assets, save time, manage gas usage and perform other automated tasks.\n\nACryptoS StableSwap helps users find the best available prices to easily swap stablecoins at low fees and with minimal slippage. Liquidity providers are incentivized with ACS and ACSI tokens to deposit their funds in ACryptoS Farms. \n\nAnother unique feature of ACryptoS is that anyone can earn harvester rewards by harvesting an ACryptoS vault. This ensures that the automation of vaults remains decentralized. Visit [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/) to learn more about yield farming and AMMs.\n\n\n#### How Many ACryptoS (ACS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nACS and ACSI tokens are native to the ACryptoS platform. ACS is a BEP-20 token. Its maximum supply is 1,888,888 tokens. After the initial emission, this supply is subject to an 18.65% decrease every 90 days. The ACS team can mint 3% of the total supply for the ACryptos Treasury.\n\nACS can be staked in the ACS Vaults to earn aggregated returns from the fees, ACS farms and rewards.  The ACS token in the ACS vault (acsACS) is the governance token and cannot be transferred. The minimum acsACS required to create new community proposals is 88, while users need 1 token to vote.\n\nBoth ACS and ACSI have similar tokenomics, but ACSI is used as an incentive on the StableSwap. The ACSI also has a maximum supply of 1,888,888 tokens.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [mining Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin).\n\nLearn more about [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).\n\nLearn more about [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming).\n\n\n### How Is the ACryptoS Network Secured?\n\nThe platform does not utilize either proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) or proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus algorithms.

A developer can earn a percentage of the fees and BADGER tokens from the developer mining pool for every implementation. The mainnet was launched on December 3, 2020.\n\nA builder can be a single developer, a group of developers, or even a company. There are no fixed obligations to participation requirements, and anyone can create. The pillars of Badger DAO include the Badger Builders, the community-created products, the Dedicated Badger Operations team, the fairly initial distribution of the BADGER tokens for governance and the fact that all of the code is open-sourced.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Badger DAO?\n\nThe founder of Badger DAO is Chris Spadafora. He is a long-term crypto enthusiast, investor, and partner at Angelrock.\n\n\n#### What Makes Badger DAO Unique?\n\nBadger DAO has two main products: Sett and DIGG. Badger DAO is a community-driven project; as such, before any products are developed they first need to be pitched to, voted on and approved by token holders. \n\nSett is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) aggregator that has flash loan mitigation measures focused on tokenized BTC through five strategies. Once a user makes a deposit, they can earn a yield as the protocol’s smart contract does the work.\n\nIn order to incentivize this participation, farmers that deposit tokenized BTC into the Sett vault earn BADGER and DIGG. Aside from a 0.5% fee, an additional 4.5% is deducted from the profits to cover [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) and transaction costs.\n\nDIGG is a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum’s blockchain that is pegged to the price of BTC with a flexible supply and a re-base function.

It is a decentralized escrow and buyer protection system for customers in crypto-friendly markets. It enables selling assets that users do not yet have through OTC by staking collateral in the Bondly network.\n\nOver-the-counter transactions involve a minimum of two parties and usually require a lot of trust between the participants. A seller can stake collateral and ensure that the buyer will receive an asset by a specified date or on a specified condition; if the agreement is violated, the collateral is forfeited and transferred to the buyer.\n\nVendors can stake collateral and earn staking rewards.

Not only is it a currency but it's also a store of value with utility and security. As a yield farming token, it eliminates the need to interact with any contract. This means no impermanent losses to those who hold it. There are also no fees to claim any rewards which are automatically doled out. By design, it's also deflationary, with an ever-reducing supply. To sustain all of this, the protocol harvests liquidity on all transfers and converts them to LP tokens. The LP tokens can be burned, but they belong to the protocol and can never be withdrawn. Finally, it's democratic and modifiable with a DAO that allows users to decide exactly what happens to the protocol.

8086,Ditto,ditto,DITTO,active,token,"## What Is Ditto (DITTO)?\n\nDitto is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) project that runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It is a fork of the Ampleforth ([AMPL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ampleforth/)) protocol. The goal of the project is to maintain a stable price of $1. Ditto achieves this by altering the supply of the token based on the demand. \n\nWhen a token has an elastic supply, the number of tokens in circulation can either decrease or increase depending on the situation. Hence, its supply is not limited, as it automatically changes relative to demand through a balancing process called Rebase.\n\nDepending on the price target, a rebase can either be positive or negative. The rebase aims to adjust the token price to the price target, which in the case of DITTO is set at $1. If the price falls below the target, a negative rebase occurs. As a result, the supply drops and the price is expected to increase to the target value. \n\nThe opposite happens when the price is higher than the price target: a positive rebase occurs. The supply rises and DITTO price drops to the target.\n\nRegardless of the current rebase, the ratio of the users’ funds to the total supply will always remain the same. The project offers two ways through which users can make profits. They can either earn when there is a positive rebase or when the market capitalization increases.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Ditto?\n\nDitto is an open-source project that launched in December 2020. It was the second initial futures offering (IFO) on PancakeSwap. The Github account related to the project names two contributors, which are known as developerfred and chefchansey.\n\n\n#### What Makes Ditto Unique?\n\nThe project’s uniqueness lies in the elastic supply. Through dynamic rebasing, DITTO can be adjusted towards the price target. The rebase remains active until DITTO reaches the peg price.\n\nRebasing can be activated up to 6 times per day. The idea behind the rebasing is that a token’s nominal price will move towards its target over time.\n\nThe flexible rebasing ensures that the token stays unaffected by the extreme price movements of other cryptocurrencies. The rebase configuration and admin functionality is stored on a smart contract called Ditto Master.\n\nThe fact that it is based on the Binance Smart Chain allows Ditto to support lower fees and faster transactions. Ditto does not rely on any external oracles to generate price feeds. Instead, it uses a time-weighted average price (TWAP) to generate on-chain price feeds. It also recently introduced cross-chain swaps on its network.\n\n\n#### How Many Ditto (DITTO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nDITTO is an elastic supply token that runs on the BSC. As of March 2021, it has a circulating supply of 2,570,142 tokens. 70% of the DITTO supply was allocated to the public sale, 15% to liquidity providers’ (LP) staking rewards, 10% to the ecosystem fund and the remaining 5% to initial liquidity.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics).\n\nLearn more about [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).\n\nLearn more about [mining Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin).\n\n\n### How Is the Ditto Network Secured? \n\nDITTO is a BEP-20 token.

In order for a user to find the best price for a swap, they need to look at every exchange — DEX aggregators eliminate the need for manually checking, bringing efficiency to swapping on DEXs.\n\nDEX aggregators work by sourcing liquidity from different DExs, meaning that they are able to offer users better token swap rates than they could find on any single DEX, in the shortest time possible.\n\n1inch launched in August 2020 after a $2.8 million funding raise from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures and Divergence Ventures.\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch raised another $12 million in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, with others including ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima Capital and Spartan Group. The funding round was conducted through a SAFT sale (simple agreement for future tokens). \n\n1inch in winter 2020 also launched Mooniswap, its own automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)).\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch launched its 1INCH governance token, and the 1inch Network began to be governed by a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)).\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of 1inch?\n\n1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and [Anton Bukov](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/anton-bukov) over the course of the ETHNewYork hackathon in 2019.

[According to ](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/86401/dex-aggregator-1inch-raises-12-million-saft-sale)Kunz, “the 1INCH tokens are not intended to be securities [...] or an investment. The 1INCH tokens are intended to be used for their consumptive purposes on the 1inch Network, the 1INCH token protocols, and other applications that third parties may develop utilizing the 1INCH tokens and/or the permissionless blockchain-based decentralized 1inch Network."" He added at the independent board of the Cayman Islands 1inch Foundation will support the adoption of 1inch tokens.  \n\nThe 1inch token will be used to stake and participate in the governance of 1inch protocols by all holders.\n\nThe circulating supply on 1inch as of its release day on Dec. 25, 2020 is 6 percent of the total issuance, as well as .5 percent for the first two weeks of the liquidity mining program. The current total supply of 1INCH is 1.5 billion tokens.\n\nOf the total token supply, 30 percent was allocated to community incentives, and they will be passed out over the next four years in order to create an incentive for community members to be involved in protocol governance.\n\nOver a four-year period as well, 14.5 percent of the total supply will make up the protocol growth and development fund, used to issue grants, bring on developers and repay any users due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\n### How Is 1inch Network Secured?\n\n1inch is non-custodial, and all trades take place within one transaction from a user’s Ethereum-based wallet. As of December 2020, Oasis, Kyber Network, Uniswap, 0x Relays and others are integrated into 1inch’s protocol.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy 1inch (1INCH)?\n\nAfter 1inch launched in late December 2020, all wallets that had interacted with 1inch through midnight on December 24 received 1inch tokens if they met certain criteria.

8164,JulSwap,julswap,JULD,active,token,"## What Is JulSwap (JULD)?\n\nJulSwap, launched on December 29, 2020, is the equivalent of Uniswap ([UNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/)) built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). JulSwap offers the same trading engine and analytics as Uniswap and some additional features from SushiSwap ([SUSHI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/)).\n\nJulSwap offers automated, decentralized exchange of BSC-20 tokens. The goal of this project is to lower the barrier to entry in decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)). The platform allows any user to create their own liquidity pool.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of JulSwap?\n\nJustLiquidity, which is the company behind JulSwap, was founded by Tobias Graf. Graf was also the founder and CEO of QuuTech, as well as the CEO of TGG Holding GmbH.\n\n\n#### What Makes JulSwap Unique?\n\nJulSwap has low trading fees due to the fact that it was built on the BSC. It allows users to retain full custody of their funds. \n\nWhereas on UniSwap, 0.3% of all trading fees in any pool are proportionately distributed to that pool’s liquidity providers, in JulSwap, 0.25% go directly to the active liquidity providers, and the remaining 0.05% get converted back into JULb through JulSwap and distributed to the JFT Stakers.\n\nAny BEP-20 project can get listed on JulSwap for free. If a project owner or supporter wants to highlight a project on the Select Token Bar, they can bid at the end of the month in an auction for a spot on the top 10 rankings. These rewards are distributed among all JULb Holders who have more than 25 tokens in their wallets.\n\nJulSwap offers access to quick swaps, a beta decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)), staking, tokens, pairs, accounts, volume rankings, LaunchPad, governance and forums. It offers features such as an order book, limit orders, price alerts and trading view.\n\nJustLiquidity also launched JUL Wallet, which offers cross-chain support for various protocols including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)), Matic, Avalanche, Huobi Eco Chain, Tomo Chain and Rinkeby.\n\nUsers can farm JULb tokens through the use of the JustLiquidity farming pool. They can withdraw their earned interest and the deposit 24 hours after the last transaction with the smart contract.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Dash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/).\n\nLearn more about [FRED Energy](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fred-energy/).\n\nLearn how to invest in cryptocurrency on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency).\n\nLearn more about cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many JulSwap (JULD) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nJulSwap (JULD) has a circulating supply of 190,607,625 JULD and a maximum supply of 800,000,000 JULD as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the JulSwap Network Secured?\n\nJulSwap uses the already audited Uniswap code which was modified for the JulSwap DEX.

Policy trading on Helmet is market-oriented without complex mathematics. There are two kinds of policy on Helmet: SHORT Tokens and LONG tokens.\n\nHelmet also adds a mining part in its hedging tool, allowing DeFi users to enjoy yield farming while trading. Helmet supports different tokens like [Ether ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)(ETH), [CAKE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/) and [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/). Users can swap the tokens by connecting their wallets to the platform. \n\nHelmet received strategic funding from [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in March 2021 to provide a more competitive option and insurance protocol for cross-chain and on-chain trading. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Helmet.insure?\n\nHelmet.insure is a Binance Smart Chain-based P2P protocol launched by anonymous developers with a passion to redefine option trading for DeFi users.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Helmet.insure Unique?\n\nHelmet intends to create a platform where a crypto trader or holder can issue an advance price-based insurance that could hedge price fluctuation and offer rewards simultaneously. Helmet specializes in providing price shield insurance for [BSC ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain)assets, including diverse insurance depending on token holders and traders. \n\nUsers can also have two roles as either a policy supplier or policy holder. \n\nA policy supplier is the creator and seller of an insurance policy. Suppliers earn Helmet token as rewards for creating selling orders to the market. In contrast, Holders buy the insurance policy from suppliers. Once the insurance policy matures, they can choose to claim or abstain from the insurance based on the swap price. \n\nHelmet redefines option trading, ensuring that option tokens do not rely on oracles or admin, but operate independently as a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). It also provides unique insurance that is designed by policy suppliers ensuring they can flexibly assemble the parameters of an insurance policy. Anyone can participate in this market and earn rewards by simply depositing an underlying token asset. \n\nEach policy option is endorsed at the nominal value held by users, eliminating counterparty risks and ensuring that the option holder can always purchase the underlying token. Helmet also has a mining aspect that adds extra features, and users can mine HELMET tokens. \n\nHelmet is also open to all DeFi protocols and users can earn rewards based on their activities within the platform. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/).\n\nLearn about [InsurAce](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/insurace/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn about Crypto ETFs on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-etf).\n\nStay in the loop about everything cryptocurrency on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Helmet.insure (Helmet) Coins Are There in Circulation\n\nHELMET is the governance token issued by helmet.insure and has a total supply of 100 million. As of April 2021, 28% of the total market supply is currently in circulation. The HELMET token will undergo a multi-year schedule with 50 million tokens distributed in the first year.  \n\nThe token distribution is as follows: 10% for the IFO boarding plan, 7.25% will be allocated to HELMET community members. For the rest, 30% can be earned through policy mining in the first year and 50% can be earned through LPT mining in the first year, while 20% can be earned through governance or vote on proposals in the first year. Another 5% is allocated to be farmed and reserved for one year as developer fund, with the remaining 7.5% used for partnerships with BSC ecological construction as Vault. \n\n\n### How Is the Helmet.insure Network Secured?\n\nHelmet.Insure is built on the Binance Smart Chain and is secured via the [proof-of-stake ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)(POS) consensus mechanism. The platform also has on-chain monitoring and passes many security checks. \n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Helmet.insure (Helmet)?\n\nHelmet.insure (HELMET) can be bought and sold on several exchanges, including [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/), [MXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/) and [OpenOcean](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/openocean/).

8387,Auto,auto,AUTO,active,token,"## What Is Auto (AUTO)? \n\nAUTO is the native utility and [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) to the Autofarm protocol, which launched in late December 2020 on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain)). Autofarm is a cross-chain yield aggregator that enables users to get a high return on their assets from yield farming pools by staking in Autofarm vaults.\n\nAutofarm aims to be a leading DEX and yield aggregator on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) by incorporating yield optimization and [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) aggregation as a single product: this allows users to have two products within a single platform, solving the problem of registering on multiple protocols. \n\nAutofarm launched its first cross-chain vault on the Huobi ECO Chain in February 2021. Autofarm expanded its ecosystem in March 2021 by [acquiring](https://medium.com/autofarm-network/en-acquisition-of-farmfol-io-portfolio-manager-b73e1d96ff67) Farmfol.io an intelligent portfolio manager designed to simplify how users monitor and track their assets on Binance Smart Chain. \n\nThe AUTO token can be used for proposals voting and will receive fees earned from the protocol. AUTO initiated a community-fair-launched token distribution by ensuring that only vault users will have an opportunity to participate in the AUTO token vault mining programme.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Auto?\n\nAutofarm was founded by the pseudonymous entity known only as [@mildgiraffe](https://twitter.com/_mildgiraffe?s=21). Little is known about him, only that he has knowledge and experience in the crypto space and dealing with codes and [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) of the protocol went from $5 million to $537 million in less than two months, putting Autofarm on the third spot in TVL within the BSC ecosystem as of April 2021. Consequently, the price of Auto went up 654x during this period of time.  \n\n\n#### What Makes Auto Unique?\n\nA major difference between Autofarm when compared to other yield farm projects like [Beefy.Finance ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/beefy-finance/)and [ACryptoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acryptos/) is that it claims to have some of the lowest fees in the market. Autofarm also has cross-chain capabilities, initially starting out on the BSC before expanding to the Huobi ECO Chain (HECO), and more cross-chain products are planned in this roadmap. \n\nAuto has two major products: Vaults and AutoSwap.\n\n\n\n*   Vaults is a [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) platform that compounds yields at optimal intervals and offers excellent yield optimization strategies. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and compounding process. \n*   AutoSwap is a [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) aggregator that provides users the best prices for their DEX trades. It splits trades across multiple DEXes to ensure the best price value and lowest slippage. \n\nEnd users do not need to be fully versed in the underlying protocols involved or [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance). Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy similar to a crypto hedge fund, aiming to increase the deposited assets of users. \n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn about [Beefy.Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/beefy-finance/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn about [ACryptoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acryptos/)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">.</span>\n\nLearn about Polkadot on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot). \n\nLearn more about the world of cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog) blog. \n\n\n#### How Many Auto (AUTO) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nAUTO, the proprietary token of the Autofarm ecosystem, is minted linearly from Dec. 15, 2020, and the minting will end in October 2021. As of April 2021, a total of 14,600 AUTO are in circulation, with the max supply pegged at 80,000 AUTO. \n\nThe distribution of the token is as follows: 12% of the tokens generated to the development team to ensure that the protocol can keep innovating while the remaining 88% is allocated for the vault token mining program. \n\n\n### How Is the Auto Network Secured?\n\nAuto is a BEP-20 token and is secured using the [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism.

HOGE was fair-launched on February 7, 2021 with no tokens allocated to the team. Initial HOGE supply was 1,000,000,000,000 with half (500 billion) permanently burned at launch.\n\n## Deflationary Cryptocurrency\n\nA 2% tax is levied on every HOGE transaction that takes place. 1% of that tax is sent to the burn wallet and permanently removed from the supply. The other 1% is redistributed to all wallets holding HOGE outside of exchanges.\n\nHOGE launched with the intention of simply being a deflationary “Doge but DeFi”. However, a team of HOGE founders with a larger vision stewarded the project toward a more philanthropic and utilitarian roadmap.\n\nHOGE is one of the first DeFi memecoins to successfully complete a Certik audit. No critical, major, or medium findings were found. As of this writing the skynet security score is 90. https://www.certik.org/projects/hogefinance\n\nHOGE has begun minting NFT's for holders as well as sponsoring eSports and Rally Racing Trucks.\n\nIn May a Swiss verein non-profit DAO hybrid was created to enact community approved actions for the token also to sign contracts and business agreements going forward with Centralized Exchange’s. HOGE has implemented a non-profit partnership initiative including a Twitter campaign called #HogeSavesTheAnimals through which the community nominates charitable causes for HOGE to support. Under this and related initiatives HOGE has raised over $20,000 for animals.

8449,Goose Finance,goose-finance,EGG,active,token,"## What Is Goose Finance (EGG)?\n\nGoose Finance (EGG) is a second-generation yield farming mechanism that allows perpetual price increase with a sustainable and profitable farming yield and a timelock contract. It launched in February 2021.\n\nGoose Finance is trying to solve the issue of significant market fluctuations in decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) caused by users entering and exiting it with large sums of money. The unique burning mechanism works as follows: all of the farms take 4% burn when users stake. Of that, 3% is used to purchase the Golden Egg token which is then sent to the lottery pool and 1% is used to continue the development of the platform.\n\nTo prevent the issue of rug pulling, Goose Finance has removed migrator code, as inherited from [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), and timelock was applied at launch. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Goose Finance?\n\nAs of March 2021, the team behind Goose Finance remains anonymous.\n\n\n#### What Makes Goose Finance Unique?\n\nGoose Finance (EGG) is a layered farming incubator. Goose Finance launches new farms every 14 days, which users can enter perpetually, helping solve the inflation issue. One new layer token — Layer “X” Goose — spawns every 14 days, proceeding in two ways.\n\nInitial DEX offering (IDO) happens one to three days before layer farming starts and the conversion of IDO is set at 1:3. All of the pledged layer 0 eggs are then burnt. The initial liquidity price of the layers is set at around 2x of the price of the IDO.\n\nThe other way is to pledge layer 0 eggs into a nest that cannot unstake and generates Layer “X” Goose forever.\n\nThere’s also the omega lottery burning mechanism, where all farms have a 4% burning fee per stake, 3% of which is used to purchase Golden Egg and inject it into the lottery pool. 20% of the lottery pool — known as the burning fee — as well as the lottery ticket costs, are burnt. \n\nThe EGG token is a BEP-20 token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead more about [eBoost](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eboostcoin/).\n\nRead more about [OMG Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/omg/).\n\nLearn how to gift someone crypto on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-gift-someone-crypto).\n\nEnhance your knowledge of cryptocurrencies with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Goose Finance (EGG) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nGoose Finance (EGG) has a circulating supply of 1,089,885 EGG and no maximum supply data is available as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Goose Finance Network Secured?\n\nGoose Finance attempts to create a cleaner environment for people to farm yield. They have removed the migrator backdoor found in PancakeSwap and SushiSwap ([SUSHI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/)).\n\nThe team behind it is prevented from mitigating assets by the code, ensuring the safety of the funds.

Berry Data offers a trustless, decentralized alternative for off-chain data acquisition. It provides the necessary infrastructure for decentralized applications to query off-chain data by properly incentivizing miners to provide valid data.\n\nBerry Data is an oracle system where parties can request the value of an off-chain data point and miners can compete to add this value to an on-chain data-bank which can be accessed by decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThe inputs to this data-bank are secured through a staked miner network. Berry Data utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms that reward data submissions made by miners while pushing out bad actors. This is ensured through Berry Data’s governance token BRY as well as a dispute mechanism.\n\nMiners are incentivized to submit data via inflationary rewards, and the data types they update are chosen based on the tips assigned to each query. DApps and other data users can gain access to the latest data feeds by paying a service fee in BRY. They can also request additional data and price feeds by offering rewards as an incentive to miners. \n\nEvery 3 minutes, the BERRY smart contract groups the top most funded data types and creates a proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) challenge for the miners to solve. The first miner to provide the PoW solution for the off-chain data point is rewarded with newly minted tokens and the accumulated service fee for that specific data request.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Berry Data? \n\nKey members of the team behind Berry Data are John WU, Mandy NG and Dr. Tom HAO.\n\nJohn WU is Berry Data’s CTO and a former IRISnet senior technical architect. Before that, Wu used to work as a community code contributor for the Cosmos Project. \n\nMandy NG is Berry Data’s COO and a former KuCoin exchange BD manager with experience in coin listings in the APAC region.\n\nDr. Tom HAO is Berry Data’s leading scientist. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from Jilin University in China. \n\n\n#### What Makes Berry Data Unique? \n\nBRY is Berry Data’s governance token designed to create a transparent, community-owned, open-source oracle platform built for the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) ecosystem on top of the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nBerry Data implements a 23% ecosystem fund. This revenue stream is managed by the Berry team and is utilized to incentivize token holding, data collection and validation, the development of new tech and open-source DApps and participation in governance.\n\nBerry Data works with DeFi projects on BSC by providing customized oracle tools at reasonable fees.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Siacoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/siacoin/).\n\nLearn more about [United Traders Tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uttoken/).\n\nRead about the eight key women in crypto on [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/8-key-women-in-crypto-in-honor-of-international-womens-day).\n\nDeepen your knowledge of crypto with [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Berry Data (BRY) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBerry Data (BRY) has a circulating supply of 2,000,000 tokens and a maximum supply of 7,500,000 BRY as of March 2021.\n\n\n### How Is the Berry Data Network Secured?\n\nData values on the Berry network can be disputed and taken off-chain. The longer a user waits to dispute the data after it has been submitted on-chain, the more probable it is to remain there, enhancing security.\n\nAny party can challenge the data submission of any miner on the condition that the challenger submits a dispute fee along with each challenge. Once a dispute fee has been submitted, the potentially malicious data miner is placed in a locked state for the duration of the vote.\n\nIn the following 48 hours, BRY holders can vote on the validity of the mined value. All BRY token holders can vote on the dispute and are incentivized to maintain a network of honest oracles.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Berry Data (BRY)?\n\nBerry Data (BRY) can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n*   [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/)\n*   [OpenOcean](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/openocean/)\n\nIf you want to learn more about how buying cryptocurrency works, feel free to read CoinMarketCap’s [dedicated guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).\n",,,"oracles, binance-smart-chain","Oracles, Binance Smart Chain",https://berrydata.co/,https://twitter.com/berry_data,https://medium.com/berry-data-official,https://t.me/berrydata,https://bscscan.com/token/0xf859Bf77cBe8699013d6Dbc7C2b926Aaf307F830,,https://docs.berrydata.co/whitepaper/berry-token,https://github.com/berrydata,,1839,2021-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,,True

8551,DeFi100,defi100,D100,active,token,"## What Is DeFi100 (D100)?\n\nIn 2020, decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) was the fastest-growing segment in the cryptocurrency market. DeFi100 (D100) is a synthetic index fund protocol and a rebase project on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/bsc/)). It is a pseudo-stable cryptocurrency managed via a so-called rebase that takes place every day.\n\nIt was designed to reflect the capitalization of and to serve as an investment vehicle for the entire DeFi market. It can also be used as a speculative asset by traders.\n\nDeFi100 presale took place in the last week of February 2021 on the BSC [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) Launchpad.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of DeFi100?\n\nDeFi100 claims to be the first rebase project on[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BinanceSmartChain&src=hashtag_click)the Binance Smart Chain. It was launched by [Wrapp3d](https://wrapp3d.com/), a group of developers who design and adopt synthetic assets. Their main goal is to introduce indices and tradable assets to the crypto token economy. The team works anonymously. \n\n\n#### What Makes DeFi100 (D100) Unique?\n\nDeFi100 is a digital asset with a capitalization that is based on the total DeFi industry market cap at the ratio of 1:100 billion. \n\nThe process of rebasing takes place when the spot price of DeFi100 is not in balance with its target price. Rebase can be positive (the spot price is above the target price, so the token supply expands to lower the spot price) or negative (the spot price is below the target price, so the token supply decreases).\n\nThe D100 token is pegged to the value of the total DeFi market cap, which changes every day. The role of the rebase function is to keep DeFi100 pegged to the DeFi market cap.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).\n\nLearn more about [Ampleforth](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ampleforth/).\n\nRead more about decentralized finance at [CoinMarketCap Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance).\n\nFor the latest crypto news, visit the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many DeFi100 (D100) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe D100 token follows a pattern of elastic supply. The rebase function is used regularly to achieve a balance between the spot price and the target price.\n\nDeFi100 was launched with a circulating supply of 2,500,000 tokens. Bidding was available at BakerySwap, and the tokens were distributed immediately after the presale. Added liquidity is locked for 11 months, starting in February 2021.\n\nOf the total D100 supply, 5% was reserved for the team, 25% was allocated to liquidity pool staking and farming, 20% to liquidity mining (of which 8% is the ecosystem reserve and 12% is liquidity) and the remaining tokens were allocated to the public sale.\n\n\n### How Is the DeFi100 Network Secured?\n\nDeFi100 (D100) is a BSC-based BEP-20 token. D100 receives price data using decentralized [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) from the Decentralised Information Asset (DIA). Using these feeds allows D100 to execute rebasing every 24 hours.\n\nOracles are essential to D100’s operation, as they provide smart contracts with off-chain data, serving as adapters between blockchain and the real world.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy DeFi100 (D100)?\n\nD100 tokens can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n*   [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bilaxy/)\n*   [BakerySwap ](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bakeryswap/)\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

8719,Illuvium,illuvium,ILV,active,token,"## What Is Illuvium (ILV)?\n\nIlluvium is an open-world fantasy battle game built on the Ethereum blockchain. Often touted as the first AAA game on Ethereum, Illuvium looks to provide a source of entertainment to both casual gamers and hardcore DeFi fans through a range of collecting and trading features.\n\nThe world of Illuvium is inhabited by creatures known as Illuvials, who can be captured by players that best them in battle and nurse them back to health. From then on, they become a loyal part of the player’s collection and can be used when battling other adventurers as part of Illuvium’s auto battler gameplay. \n\nThe game is a fusion between an open-world exploration game and a PVP battle game. Players can spend their time exploring the expanses of the game world or building up their team of powerful beasts. \n\nIlluvium has been in development since 2020, and is being built by a worldwide team of more than 40 individuals, including the co-founders; serial entrepreneur and early cryptocurrency adopter Kieran Warwick, and experienced game designer Aaron Warwick, who are brothers. (And who are coincidentally also the brothers of Kain Warwick, the co-founder of DeFi platform Synthetix).\n\nThe ILV token has a number of uses within the Illuvium ecosystem. It’s the main token used to reward players for their in-game achievements, entitles players to their share of the Illuvium Vault and is used for participating in the governance of the game via the Illuvium decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). \n\n## How Does Illuvium Work?\nAlthough Illuvium has blockchain-based elements, it is more akin to a full-fledged video game. It’s accessed through a downloadable desktop app, but also has a range of supporting DeFi applications surrounding it — including a yield farm and decentralized exchange. \n\nPlayers roam the Illuvium landscape battling Illuvials and other players, participating in quests and daily challenges, and participating in its communal storyline. Throughout their journey, they collect Illuvials, which have a range of characteristics that make them variable in their rarity, utility, and desirability. These include:\n\n* Classes: Empath, Fighter, Guardian, Rogue and Psion.\n* Affinities: Air, Earth, Fire, Nature and Water.\n\nThrough its class and affinity are its most important attributes, each Illuvial has a large number of additional attributes that also help determine its strength in combat, some of these can include: attack damage, attack speed, and savagery. Illuvials get stronger with victory, can be enhanced with in-game items and can be upgraded into a special “ascended” form — which benefits from two affinities at once. \n\nEach Illuvial is represented by a unique non-fungible token (NFT) and can be freely traded on external exchange platforms and the gas-free IlluviDEX (more on this later). They can also be fused into more powerful forms, and come in normal, holographic and dark holographic variants which are considerably more scarce. \n\nThe game will feature a variety of revenue streams, mostly derived from in-game purchases of items, crafting components, cosmetics and shard curing. 100% of this revenue is distributed as rewards to those staking the ILV tokens through an ILV buyback system.\n\n## What Makes Illuvium Unique?\nUnlike most other blockchain-powered games, Illuvium features a fully 3D environment, with over 100 unique Illuvials found scattered throughout its various regions. Each Illuvial is designed by a team of world-class artists, ensuring it appeals to players accustomed to big-budget retail games.\n\nBeyond this, it boasts a number of features that help it stand out from both other blockchain-enabled games and AAA titles. These include:\n\n* Layer-2 Integration: Although Illuvium is secured by Ethereum, it is built on Immutable X (IMX) — a layer-2 solution that is designed to help scale applications with NFT functionality.  By leveraging Immutable X’s capabilities, Illuvium ensures players can mint and trade their NFTs with zero gas fees and practically instant transaction finality. Players always maintain custody of their assets while using IMX. \n* The IlluviDEX:  Illuvium features a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) platform appropriately named the IlluviDEX. This can be used for trustlessly exchanging Illuvium assets, including Illuvial NFTs. A 5% fee is deducted from each sale and funneled into the rewards pool for ILV stakers. \n* Yield Farming: A total of 3 million ILV — equivalent to 30% of the maximum supply (10 million) — are allocated to the Illuvium yield farming program. These will be distributed over a period of three years to users contributing liquidity and through various partner reward schemes. \n\n## What Is sILV?\n\nIlluvium features a unique yield farming reward system, in that all ILV rewards earned through the yield farm are locked for a period of one year before they can be withdrawn.\n\nHowever, stakers have the option to skip the unlock timer by converting their ILV rewards to a secondary in-game only asset known as sILV. By claiming their rewards as sILV, users receive the USD equivalent of sILV, and can spend their rewards early to purchase in-game items. \n\nSILV cannot be withdrawn from the game and is not represented by a blockchain-based asset. \n\n## How Does Illuvium Compare With Axie Infinity?\n\nAlthough both Illuvium and Axie Infinity feature collectible in-game characters that can be battled, traded and upgraded, the scope of the game world surrounding these critters differs somewhat. \n\nOn one side, Illuvium is a 3D role-playing game with a gradually revealed storyline and massive, open, explorable landscape, whereas Axie Infinity is a highly popular, quirky 2D game that features adorable critters known as Axies that are reminiscent of Pokemon. These Axies can be bred, battled, and traded. For now, there is no story mode to speak of. \n\nBoth Illuvium and Axie Infinity feature a strong gamified DeFi element, which means there can be real Ether (ETH) at stake while playing either — since some Illuvials and Axies could fetch significant sums on the open market. \n\nUnlike Axie Infinity, which uses a random assortment of assets to produce each individual Axie, Illuvium’s Illuvials are wholly unique. Each one features custom artwork and rigging to ensure they are distinct and bear characteristics that relate to their properties and region. \n\nThe two games clearly have some similarities, but Illuvial is primarily targeted towards traditional gamers who may or may not have experience with cryptocurrencies and NFTs, while Axie Infinity would mostly appeal to the crypto savvy.

8891,Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token,btc-standard-hashrate-token,BTCST,active,token,"## What Is Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST)?\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) was launched on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) on Dec. 13, 2020. It is collateralized by Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) [hashrate](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hash-power-hash-rate), with each token representing 0.1 TH/s of Bitcoin mining power at an efficiency of 60 W/TH. As such, miners contribute their computational power to the platform in exchange for newly minted BTCST tokens.\n\nBTCST’s goal is to bridge liquidity to Bitcoin’s mining market. This will allow users to get exposure to mining rewards and hashpower of any size, at a low cost. The ultimate goal of the app is to increase the liquidity and efficiency of mining power markets.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token?\n\nThe Standard Hashrate Group, which is behind the BTCST token, is backed by industrial-scale Bitcoin miners, which collectively represented 12% of BTC’s global hashrate as of February 2021.\n\n\n#### What Makes Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token Unique?\n\nBTCST is a token collateralized by real Bitcoin mining power; by staking BTCST, holders can receive daily Bitcoin contributions that correspond to the staked mining power. As such, BTCST allows users to mine Bitcoin from inside the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) ecosystem.\n\nBTCST tokens can only be issued when eligible miners choose to standardize and tokenize Bitcoin hashrate. This is why the project hasn’t had any private or public sale events. The total supply cap is determined by the sum of all BTCST tokens staked on the app.\n\nBTCST is based on the BEP-20 standard. Snapshots of user balances and total pool balances are taken each hour in order to calculate user rewards. Each pool’s annual percentage yield (APY) and total balance are updated in real-time, and tokens can only be staked in one pool at a time. Users are allowed to unstake their funds at any time and participate in any of the other available pools.\n\nBTCST is a cloud mining platform deployed on the Binance Smart Chain. It offers daily payouts that are executed by a decentralized application ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)).\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about [Civic](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/civic/).\n\nLearn more about [Zilliqa](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/).\n\nLearn about crypto ETFs on [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-etf).\n\nBecome more knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies on the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nBTCST was launched on December 13, 2020, with an initial token supply of 1,000,000 tokens. \n\nAs of March 2021, it has a circulating supply of 589,388 BTCST and a maximum supply of 1,500,000 BTCST. \n\n\n### How Is the Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token Network Secured?\n\nThe Binance Pool functions as the auditor for BTCST and guarantees legitimacy and transparency. BTCST is an asset protocol that brings Bitcoin hashrate assets to DeFi and serves as a foundation for other DeFI trading, lending and borrowing protocols.\n\nBTCST is governed in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao)). The token holders, miners and the broader token community collectively decide on material issues associated with the project. All proposals, votes and outcomes are recorded and disclosed on-chain.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST)?\n\nBitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) can be traded on the following exchanges:\n\n\n\n*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)\n*   [VCC Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/vcc-exchange/)\n*   [WBF Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/wbf-exchange/)\n*   [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap/)\n\nRead our guide on how to [buy Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) to find out more.\n",BTCStandardHashrate,BTCST has undergone a 1:10 token redenomination on March 15th 2021 following the STP-4 Proposal.

8916,Internet Computer,internet-computer,ICP,active,coin,"## What is the Internet Computer (ICP)?\n\nThe Internet Computer is the world’s first blockchain that runs at web speed with unbounded capacity. It also represents the third major blockchain innovation, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum — a blockchain computer that scales smart contract computation and data, runs them at web speed, processes and stores data efficiently, and provides powerful software frameworks to developers. By making this possible, the Internet Computer enables the complete reimagination of software — providing a revolutionary new way to build tokenized internet services, pan-industry platforms, decentralized financial systems, and even traditional enterprise systems and websites.\nThe project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams, and attracted notable interest from the crypto community. DFINITY raised a total of $121 million from contributors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, SV Angel, Aspect Ventures, Electric Capital, ZeroEx, Scalar Capital, and Multicoin Capital, and several notable early Ethereum supporters. In 2018, over 50,000 registerter participants received ICP utility tokens in an airdrop. On December 18, 2020, DFINITY launched the alpha mainnet of the Internet Computer. In a final step towards decentralization, on May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain. This major milestone means that the internet now functions as a decentralized global computer — marked by the release of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token allowing tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Internet Computer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-dfinity-icp).\n\n## Who Is The Founder of the Internet Computer?\nDominic Williams is the Founder and Chief Scientist of DFINITY. He is a crypto theoretician, responsible for inventing Threshold Relay, Probabilistic Slot Consensus, and other novel crypto techniques, serial entrepreneur, and early member of the Bitcoin and Ethereum technical communities. Previously, he was President and CTO of String Labs, an incubator for venture-backed crypto projects, early pioneer of DeFi at Mirror Labs, and Founder and CEO of Fight My Monster, a MMO game for children that scaled to millions of users. He also founded several startups such as System7, Airdocs and Smartdrivez. Graduated King’s College London 1st in Class in Computer Science.\n\n## What is the DFINITY Foundation?\nThe Internet Computer was incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation, a not-for profit scientific research organization based in Zurich, Switzerland, comprised of the world’s top cryptographers and distributed systems and programming language experts, with nearly 100,000 academic citations and 200 patents collectively. Notable technologists at DFINITY include:\n* Jan Camenisch, PhD (VP of Research) - world-renowned cryptographer &amp; privacy researcher, led IBM’s Cryptography / Research department for 19 years\n* Andreas Rossberg, PhD (Principal Engineer and Researcher) - the co-creator of WebAssembly and former team lead for the Google Chrome V8 engine\n* Ben Lynn, PhD (Sr Staff Engineer and Researcher) - world-renowned cryptographer and Google Engineer, the “L” in BLS cryptography, the key signature system being used in Ethereum 2.0\n* Jens Groth, PhD (Principal Researcher) - world-renowned cryptographer, known for pioneering non-interactive zero knowledge proofs\n* Timo Hanke, PhD (Principal Researcher) - creator of AsicBoost, one of the few proven algorithmic optimizations for Bitcoin mining\n* Paul Liu, PhD (Staff Engineer) - architected Intel’s Haskell compiler and received his PhD under Paul Hudak, a key designer of Haskell\n* Johan Georg Granström, PhD (Director of Engineering) - former Sr Staff Software Engineer at Google responsible for scaling YouTube system infrastructure\nAfter public launch on May 10, 2021, the DFINITY Foundation will now be one of many organizations committed to improving and maintaining the Internet Computer network.\n\n## What Makes the Internet Computer Unique?\n\nThe purpose of the Internet Computer is to extend the public internet, so it can also be the world’s compute platform. Today, the internet is a network that connects everybody and everything, but systems and services currently run from private infrastructure.\nThe scientific breakthrough behind the Internet Computer is Chain Key Technology, which encompasses dozens of advanced technology such as novel Consensus, Non-Interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), Network Nervous System (NNS), Internet Identity, etc.\nChain Key Technology consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the nodes that make up the Internet Computer. It is one of the fundamental breakthroughs behind the Internet Computer, enabling it to have a single public key. This is a huge advantage because it allows any device, including smart watches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer. In contrast, this is not possible for traditional blockchains.\nThe single public key is just the tip of the iceberg: Chain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for adding new nodes to form new subnets to scale the network infinitely; replacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without ever stopping; reviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed; and upgrading the Internet Computer Protocol seamlessly, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features.\nThe DFINITY R&D team has invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation. Throughout the lifetime of a subnet, it is known by a single public key, and the other parties on the Internet Computer do not have to keep track of changing public keys.\n\n## Who Runs the Nodes in the Internet Computer Network?\nAt Genesis on May 10, 2021, the Internet Computer is supported by 48 independent data centers — located across North America, Europe, and Asia — running 1,300 nodes. The network will continue to grow exponentially to support the next generation of mega dapps, with 123 data centers running 4,300 nodes scheduled by the end of the year, and eventually thousands of data centers running millions of nodes to support the decade-long building out of the Open Internet.\nImportantly, anyone can become a node provider, interested parties apply for a Data Center ID (DCID) to the Network Nervous System (NNS), procure specialized machine nodes, install the ICP protocol, and connects to the Internet Computer network.\n\n## How Fast is the Internet Computer Network?\nThe scientific breakthrough called Chain Key Technology allows the Internet Computer to run at web speed — where query calls execute in milliseconds, and update calls take 1-2 seconds to finalize. More importantly, at Genesis, the Internet Computer will have a block rate of 2.5 blocks per second (bps), then quickly to an industry leading bps of 10.3 bps, and ~1,000 bps by end of the year.\nIn the case of an open version of Reddit running on the Internet Computer, when a user browses the forum, customized views of the hosted content would be formulated and served into their web browser by the execution of query calls, which run in milliseconds on a nearby node, providing a fantastic user experience. But when a user wishes to occasionally make a post, or provide a tip of tokens to the author of a post, this would involve update calls, which would take 1–2 seconds.\n\n## What Does the ICP Token Do?\n\nICP are native utility tokens that play three key roles in the network:\n\n* Facilitating Network Governance: ICP tokens can be locked to create neurons that participate in network governance by voting, through which they can earn economic rewards.\n* Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP provides a source store of value that can be converted into cycles; which power computation in the role of fuel that is burned when it is used. The NNS converts ICP to cycles at a variable rate, so chosen to ensure users of the network can always create new cycles at approximately constant cost in real terms, such that the cost of acquiring fuel is predictable.\n* Rewarding Participants: The network mints new ICP to reward and incentivize those playing important roles that enable the network to function, including: a) the provision of voting rewards to those participating in governance, b) the provision of voting rewards; to those operating the node machines hosting the network, and c) other miscellaneous activities.\n\n## What Do Cycles Do?\nCycles power computation in the role of fuel. They also have a constant value over the long-term, which contrasts with ICP, whose value will naturally vary over time. Moreover, Cycles will be pegged to the SDR, which is a logical currency unit defined by the International Monetary Fund, and 1 SDR worth of ICP can be converted into exactly one trillion Cycles to power computation.\n\n## What Do Neurons Do?\nA neuron locks a balance of ICP utility tokens and enables its owner to participate in network governance, through which they can earn voting rewards.\n\n## Who Are the Natural Buyers for ICP Tokens?\n* Token Holders who want to participate in network governance and earn voting rewards\n* Developers who need to convert ICP tokens into Cycles to pay for computation\n\n## ICP Token Supply and Tokenomics?\nThere will be 469,213,710 ICP tokens at Genesis.\nCirculating supply depends on the dynamics of the market. However, it is approximated to be 26% at Genesis.\nGenesis Initial State Token Allocations\n\n\n* Early contributors: 9.50%\n* Seed donations: 24.72%\n* Strategic: 7.00%\n* Presale: 4.96%\n* Strategic partnerships: 3.79%\n* Community airdrop: 0.80%\n* Initial community and developer grants: 0.48%\n* Node operators: 0.22%\n* Internet Computer Association: 4.26%\n* Team members: 18.00%\n* Advisors and other third-party token holders: 2.40%\n* DFINITY Foundation: 23.86%\n\n## How Does the Internet Computer Network Nervous System Work for Voting?\nThe NNS works by receiving proposals and deciding to adopt or reject them based on voting activity by neurons; that network participants have created. Neurons are also used by participants to submit new proposals. After submission, proposals are either adopted or rejected, which can happen almost immediately or after some delay, depending on how the totality of neurons vote.\n\n## Who Might List the Internet Computer?\nCoinbase, Huobi and OKEx have announced they will list Internet Computer utility tokens (ICP) when the Internet Computer launches on May 10 at 9AM PT / May 11 12AM China Time. \n\n## What Are The Prominent Projects In The Internet Ecosystem?\nThe Internet Computer launched with several high profile entrepreneurs and applications being built on it. These include:\n\n### DeFi\n* Enso Finance – Decentralized exchange that has raised $5mn\n* Tacen – A high-performance non-custodial exchange that has raised $2.5mn\n* SailFish – A gateway to open financial services\n\n### Social\n* Distrikt – A decentralized, professional social media network.

9218,Mist,mist,MIST,active,token,"## What Is Mist (MIST)?\n\nMist is an NFT open-world role-playing game ecosystem on the Binance Smart Chain ([BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/binance-smart-chain/)). It offers users the ability to easily exchange in-game assets without any intermediaries. The developers, in turn, can attract new users and receive additional income from the sale of game items and tokens.\n\nMist launched in Q1 2021 and is built around NFTs, staking and farming. The Mist Universe and all its elements run on the BSC with the MIST token acting as the main in-game currency used to buy NFTs.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Mist?\n\nMist is a Binance Smart Chain-based action RPG that was created by anonymous developers. \n\nFrom the beginning of April 2021, Mist has partnered with Solid Group, KickPad, Solidity Finance, Vendetta Capital, DuckDAO, MANTRA DAO, AU21 Capital, JUN Capital, Exnetwork Capital and X21 Digital. \n\nThe team’s key advisors include Timothea Horwell (Orion Protocol), Eric Su (Exnetwork Capital) and Garlam Won.\n\n\n#### What Makes Mist (MIST) Unique?\n\nThe game is based on the in-house gaming platform Mist NFT Game Framework (MNGF). MNGF is a created environment with five playable character classes and their various abilities. The NFTs in Mist are functional: they can be added to the Mist Game Framework and turned into game elements. They can also be traded in two ways: on in-game exchanges and on third-party NFT exchanges.\n\nThe main purpose of the MIST token is to buy and exchange NFTs both in the game and beyond. Participants can list their NFTs for sale and swap them for MIST tokens via in-game auction houses.\n\nThe native token can be staked outside of the Mist Universe. When someone places bets or uses MIST for farming, a reward is generated. The token runs on the Binance Smart Chain and is compatible with every wallet on the network.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nRead about [The Sandbox](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-sandbox/).\n\nRead about [Blockchain Cuties Universe Governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blockchain-cuties-universe/).\n\nLearn more about NFTs with [CMC Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft).\n\nExpand your knowledge of crypto with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n\n#### How Many Mist (MIST) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nMIST is a cryptocurrency token based on the Binance blockchain with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

In this smart shopping system, the sellers and each product they sell are identified as a unique tokenID. Once the transaction is completed, the buyer's ownership will be confirmed immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Why is the NFTD necessary?\r\n\r\nCurrently buying on online shopping systems. the seller only ships the product directly to the buyer but does not give clear proof of ownership of the product. Sometimes this reduces the value of the goods if the buyer later wants to sell them to someone else. With NFTD this issue is resolved, every transaction completed on Uquid Shop will include proof of the owner with the goods customer purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NFTD Mission\r\n\r\nOur long-term goal is to bring NFTs to everyday life. We wanted to simplify the visual concepts of NFTs that are difficult for buyers to understand and implement now.

9269,Refinable,refinable,FINE,active,token,"Blockchain as a whole has experienced several major technological trends in the last decade, beginning with the advent of bitcoin, to the emergence of separate blockchain platforms, and most recently the craze of decentralized finance projects. However, none of these trends have captured the immediate and tangible imagination of the general public like non-fungible tokens(NFTs) have. Akin to how bitcoin has challenged the existing notion of money, NFTs are now on track to challenge the fundamental notion of ownership.\n\nWith the massive excitement at NFT projects such as NBA TopShots and SoRare, where real-world content is tokenized into certifiably ownable NFTs, communities have demonstrated that digital collectibles can draw immense value from a shared understanding of value and context. It has been exciting seeing communities ranging from gaming to digital art, music to memes all begin to engage in leveraging NFT technology to create and tokenize content for their users. With the NFT market still in its infancy, we as a community should continue to enable and foster playful experimentation to unlock the deepest potential of NFTs.\n\nHowever, as more communities and users begin to interact with existing NFT projects, the issue of scalability and mass onboarding becomes apparent. Etherereum transaction fees have been skyrocketing due to massive activities in other blockchain projects, causing the average users to pay upwards of $60USD for creating or transacting an NFT token. Platform commission fees have been equally exorbitant, while other users wait for months to be verified on select platforms - so we decided to create a one-stop NFT solution addressing these and much more.\n\nWithout further ado, we are excited to officially announce the public reveal of our project.\n\nAs the first major NFT hub on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Refinable is the definitive platform to create, discover, trade, and leverage any digital content on the blockchain. We believe in bringing about the adoption of NFTs for the masses whilst also allowing for the communal experimentation of this new medium.

First launched to a limited investor base in January 2018, TrueUSD has since grown to incorporate almost $400 million of backed tokens as of October 2020.\n\nTrueUSD is one of a number of cryptocurrency stablecoins administered by TrustToken, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets.\n\nAs with other stablecoins, TrueUSD aims to facilitate increased liquidity and provide cryptocurrency traders and general users with a nonvolatile asset relative to free-floating tokens such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC).\n\nAs of October 2020, TUSD is the 38th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of TrueUSD?\n\nTrueUSD is a stablecoin launched by parent company TrustToken, whose co-founder and CEO is Rafael Cosman.\n\nCosman has a lifelong attachment to cryptography, studying it along with artificial intelligence (AI) before working at both Google Brain and software company Palantir. He left Google to create TrustToken in 2017.\n\nCosman has stated that TrueUSD was always just the start of TrustToken’s product line, involving relatively little work in return for creating a high-impact asset. \n\nAt the time of launch, he noted that regular auditing of the stablecoin formed an important focus for the company, giving investors peace of mind at a time when many cryptoassets were seeing heavy volatility in the wake of the initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) phenomenon.\n\n\n#### What Makes TrueUSD Unique?\n\nTrueUSD aims to balance stability and utility — the main use cases of any stablecoin — with security in the form of regular attestations. \n\nFrom its launch onwards, parent company TrustToken has sought to underscore the importance of independent verification of the stablecoin’s provenance. As such, the stablecoin’s appeal is geared towards larger investors looking to reduce risk, in addition to smaller private traders.\n\nTrustToken describes TUSD as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.”\n\nTrueUSD is part of an ever-expanding stablecoin market, which now includes a large number of USD-backed assets. [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT) remains by far the largest, with a market cap of $15 billion as of October 2020, compared to TUSD’s $382 million.\n\nTrustToken has entered various corporate partnerships as part of its business activities, including options for TUSD holders to increase annualized passive income returns.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\nLearn more about Tether [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/).\n\nLearn more about USD Coin [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/).\n\nNew to cryptocurrency?

Given its status as a stablecoin, the supply is uncapped, and will continue to expand according to demand.\n\nThere are two incarnations of TUSD available: an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and another, also known as TUSDB, a BEP-2 token on Binance Chain.\n\nTrueUSD’s equivalent redeemability for USD is maintained via partnerships with banks and fiduciary entities.\n\n\n### How Is the TrueUSD Network Secured?\n\nTrustToken aims to deliver maximum transparency using tools such as real-time auditing of TUSD’s backing and reliability. \n\nBeyond trusting the validity of its USD peg, any security issues relate to those which affect all ERC-20 standard tokens. Transactions, for example, can suffer from abnormally high fees if [gas prices](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) on the Ethereum blockchain spike.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy TrueUSD (TUSD)?\n\nAs one of the largest USD stablecoins, TUSD is freely available on major exchanges, with pairs for cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins available.\n\nAmong the largest volume currently belongs to [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and DeFi automated market maker [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/).\n\nNew to crypto?

Players can spend BNB, BUSD and other BSC-based tokens in the game to participate in game yield farming. The game system has a great token deflation mechanism and dividend bonus model.\n\nThe total amount of CTT tokens is 1 million, and 5% of the on-chain transaction amount will be burnt.\n\n# **Who are the founders of CryptoTycoon?**\n\nAll the founding members of CryptoTycoon have worked in Tencent Interactive Entertainment (IEG), and have been involved in product planning and front-end operations in first-line online games. After entering the crypto industry, the team still keeps paying attention to the gaming industry, and constantly seeks to lower the barriers to user participation of gamified DeFi products.  \n\nFor team background and CMO introduction, please read our[ Team Information](https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/whitepapers/team-background).\n\n# **What is Monopoly Tycoon?**\n\nMonopoly Tycoon is a monopoly game built on CryptoTycoon. To participate in-game mining, players can spend BNB, BUSD, USDT and other BSC tokens in the game to get a chance to roll the dice and build different types of buildings on different grids. In order to ensure the game has a good deflation and dividend model, once a house or shop is constructed and cannot pay taxes on time, it will be removed. \n\n# **What is FishSwap?**\n\nFishSwap is a fishing game built on CryptoTycoon. Players can spend BNB and BUSD to draw NFT Mystery Box for fishing rods in the game, so as to catch fish with different attributes in the fish pond. Whenever players catch the fish, players can then put the fish in their own fish ponds to get CTT mining output. At the same time, the game has a good token deflation mechanism and dividend model. Each fishing rod has its own durability, and each fish also has its own life cycle. If the player does not repair the fishing rod, it will be destroyed when the durability is 0.\n\n# **What is NFTSwap?**\n\nNFTSwap is the game prop store of the CryptoTycoon platform, which contains NFT information and purchase links for various games. Since the CryptoTycoon platform has acquired various NFTSwap first-level domain names from the market before the establishment of the CryptoTycoon platform, the game prop store is named NFTSwap. At present, the main function of the store is to display NFT character cards, game props, etc. It does not have transaction functions. Each NFT will mark the link to the transaction portal.\n\n# **Why $CTT?**\n\nCTT is the game token of CryptoTycoon, which has both functional and governance usages. It is currently running on Binance Smart Chain. The CryptoTycoon team has adopted a scientific mechanism and a method that has been verified many times by the market to design the CTT economic model.  \n\nAs CryptoTycoon continues to support more different chain CTT consumption, CTT will also circulate on more chains.  \n\nFor the usage, deflation, and distribution of CTT tokens, please refer to our[ Token Information](https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/whitepapers/ctt-tokens-and-institutional-fundraising).\n\n# **What’s our Positioning?**\n\nCryptoTycoon is positioned to gamify the DeFi product, thereby reducing the threshold for players to get started. At the same time, CryptoTycoon's first release is built on the retail investor-friendly BSC blockchain, which has a good ecology and user base. Which can help the game advance in the right direction, keep iterating and updating, and provide a good motivation.\n\n# **Join us:**\n\n**Website: **[ http://cryptotycoon.finance/](http://cryptotycoon.finance/)\n\n**Twitter: **[https://twitter.com/CryptoTycoon_GP](https://twitter.com/CryptoTycoon_GP)\n\n**TG:** [https://t.me/CryptoTycoonCTT](https://t.me/CryptoTycoonCTT)\n\n**Medium: **[ cryptotycoon-gp.medium.com](https://cryptotycoon-gp.medium.com/)\n\n**Github: **[ https://github.com/CryptoTycoon](https://github.com/CryptoTycoon)\n\n**Whitepaper: **[https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/ ](https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/)\n\n",,,"collectibles-nfts, defi, gaming, binance-smart-chain","Collectibles & NFTs, DeFi, Gaming, Binance Smart Chain",https://www.cryptotycoon.finance/,https://twitter.com/CryptoTycoon_GP,https://t.me/CryptoTycoonCTT,https://t.me/CryptoTycoonCTT,https://bscscan.com/token/0x464863745ed3af8b9f8871f1082211c55f8f884d,,https://docs.cryptotycoon.co/,,https://cryptotycoon-gp.medium.com/,1839,2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,,True

9535,CrossFi,crossfi,CRFI,active,token,"## What is CrossFi\nCrossFi is an interoperability cross-chain liquidity solution for decentralized finance. CrossFi introduces a L1+L2 trust layer to help scale the transaction speed, lower the gas fee and further extendable to improve the user experience by giving users the availability to any liquidity pools, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Flow, or any other blockchain infrastructure. Developed as a way to grant liquidity to locked digital assets, the CrossFi protocol utilizes industry-leading interoperability technology to connect different assets across public chains connecting the DeFi space.\nUnderpinning the protocol’s superior interoperability is its use of the Multi-Asset Adaptor Protocol (MAP) which functions as both a bridge between compatible public chains and an adaptor network between non-compatible chains. Maintained by independent network nodes, the MAP is built upon Substrate, the open-source blockchain development framework built by Parity, which supports rapid docking and deployment of blockchain networks to the Polkadot network\n\n## Filecoin Ecosystem\nCrossFi brings together stakeholders in the filecoin ecosystem looking to utilize decentralized finance. Two leading filecoin mining manufacturers, Dataline and DCTech, are early supporters and have worked directly with the CrossFi tech team to develop the initial solution utilizing CrossFi’s MAP technology. \nThe key value CrossFi brings to the DeFi space is to give liquidity to locked digital assets similar to a bond. For example, filecoin users can stake their FIL on the filecoin network using the CrossFi protocol and mint an equivalent value amount of ERC20 compliant liquid cFIL. This is a two-way reversal process, meaning users wanting to later unlock their staked filecoin must send the equivalent amount cFIL to the redemption contract, executing a burn of the synthetic cFIL for a small settlement fee. As the protocol-supported liquidity pool is chain-agnostic and utilizes synthetic assets, there is virtually zero slippage as a result of asset swapping.\n\n## CRFI\nCRFI is a utility token used on the CrossFi ecosystem. Its multi-asset protocol allows users to collateralize native assets and projection map it to a synthetic asset on another blockchain, allowing its synthetic derivative to be traded as if native to that chain.\nCRFI is the native currency of the CrossFi ecosystem and is utilized as gas for executing on-chain operations and for paying service and transaction fees.\nCRFI will also serve as the collateral asset and trading pair for the creation of synthetic assets. Whenever a synthetic asset, such as cUSD, is minted, a collateral ratio of 200% of CRFI tokens must be staked.\nCRFI token holders can earn rewards by staking their CRFI and securing the network through validator nodes. CRFI stakers will receive staking rewards and service fees in exchange for providing the security, computation, and storage as required by the network.\nCRFI has a built-in inflationary mechanism at an annual inflation rate of 5-10%. 80% of these tokens will be redistributed pro-rate to CRFI stakers, with the remaining 20% allocated to a stabilization fund.\nThe stabilization fund is intended to help control inflation, ensure proper community incentives, and generally to hedge against risk. The stabilization fund will provide the liquidity pool for the platform stablecoin, cUSD.",,,"interoperability, dao, binance-smart-chain","Interoperability, DAO, Binance Smart Chain",https://crossfidao.com/,https://twitter.com/crossfidao,https://medium.com/crossfi/,,https://bscscan.com/token/0xae20bc46300bab5d85612c6bc6ea87ea0f186035,,,https://github.com/crossfidao,,1839,2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,2021-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,True

9632,UMI,umi,UMI,active,coin,"## What is UMI? \n \nUMI is a decentralized payment blockchain network with an open source code. It allows you to make almost instant and absolutely free transactions around the world. The UMI cryptocurrency is used as a unit of accounting within the network. \n \nUMI is a fully featured blockchain platform developed from scratch that supports the creation and execution of smart contracts. The UMI blockchain is built on the unique Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm where master nodes and validator nodes are responsible for network performance. \n \nUMI is a unique cryptocurrency issued via staking based on a smart contract. Thanks to this innovative approach, network participants can unite in structures and generate new coins at a rate of up to 40% per month, simply by holding them in their wallets.\n \n## How does UMI work? \n \nThe UMI blockchain is public meaning that all transactions are transparent, cannot be forged or canceled. Moreover, the UMI network code is published on GitLab and is available for audit. \n \nUMI code on GitLab — https://gitlab.com/umitop/umi-master.  \n \nBitcoin and the vast majority of other cryptocurrency blockchains use the Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms or their derivatives (for example, Delegated Proof-of-Stake, DPoS). This approach significantly limits their throughput and creates commission costs. \n \nUMI chose a completely different path. The heart of the network is the innovative Proof-of-Authority (PoA) technology. It ensures almost instant transactions and safe operation of the network without commission costs. \n \nThe UMI cryptocurrency bypasses the main problems inherent in the PoW and PoS algorithms: \n\n\nMaster nodes are responsible for generating new blocks. They are ""master"" nodes because special ultra-high requirements are applied to them in terms of network speed and bandwidth.\n\n\nValidator nodes support the network checking the blocks for correctness and ruling out forgery. A validator node can be launched by any UMI user, thereby making the network even more decentralized, secure and reliable.\n\n\nBesides, any network participant has the opportunity to launch a light node that allows you to view and send transactions without downloading the entire blockchain history. \n \nUse of master nodes allows us to significantly increase the bandwidth of the UMI network and, accordingly, the speed of transfers in it. \n \nNo one has the opportunity to connect to the master nodes and somehow influence their work because they work anonymously and their location is unknown to anyone. At the same time, the master nodes are distributed throughout the planet to ensure maximum decentralization and avoid the creation of a single point of failure. An attempt to create a block by another node is automatically rejected by the network. This ensures maximum security, protecting UMI from any kind of attacks. \n \nThus, PoA completely eliminates the possibility of fraud and hacking. This ensures that users ' coins will always be safe. \n \n## What makes UMI unique?\n \nThe initial PoA model does not imply either forging or mining since users are prohibited from creating new blocks for security reasons. On the one hand, this is a good thing — there is no need to purchase powerful and expensive equipment and install special software. On the other hand, users cannot be encouraged to maintain network performance which is a significant drawback. Thus, there is no mining or its alternatives in other cryptocurrencies using PoA, but there is in UMI. \n \nThe UMI network uses an improved version of this technology which relies on its advantages while also eliminating its drawbacks. Mining and forging has been replaced by an innovative staking technology based on a smart contract and used to reward users. \n \nThe unique Proof-of-Authority model with smart contract staking not only ensures maximum security of the UMI network, but also implies generous rewards for users. \n \nUMI advantages\n \nAlmost instant transactions without commissions. Bandwidth of the UMI network is up to 65,536 transactions per second. This is several thousand times more than Bitcoin. This is more than VISA or Mastercard. \n \nSafety and reliability. UMI is a fully decentralized blockchain network protected from hacks, leaks, unauthorized changes, 51% attacks, Nothing-at-Stake, third-party interference, DDoS attacks (spam transactions) and other vulnerabilities. A user who has a mnemonic phrase fully owns their coins. \n \nSupport for smart contracts. UMI is a fully featured blockchain platform that allows you to create and execute smart contracts of any complexity.\n \nStaking based on a smart contract at a rate of up to 40% per month. Each UMI user can either create their own staking structure, or join an existing one and multiply their coins at a rate of up to 40% per month. At the same time, UMI coins are not locked for staking, and only the user always has access to them. The reward for staking is awarded every second in the 24/7/365 mode. \n \nThe leading crypto-media wrote more about UMI advantages, including:\n \nCryptoPotato — https://cryptopotato.com/umi-blockchain-ecosystem-of-instant-visa-like-payments-with-zero-fees/\nBitcoinist — https://bitcoinist.com/umi-blockchain-ecosystem-instant-transfers-smart-contracts-and-profitable-staking/\nNewsBTC — https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/umi-blockchain-ecosystem-instant-transfers-smart-contracts-and-profitable-staking/\nBitnovosti — https://bitnovosti.com/2020/10/30/blokchejn-ekosistema-umi-mgnovennye-perevody-mnogofunktsionalnye-smart-kontrakty-vygodnyj-stejking/\nDeCenter — https://decenter.org/ru/blokchein-ekosistema-umi\n \n## Who created UMI?\n \nUMI was created by an anonymous and completely independent development team at its own expense. As was the case with Bitcoin, the creators of UMI are anonymous. This is done for the network to be as decentralized as possible. There is no single entity that someone could influence and thus harm the UMI network. \n \nOngoing development and future plans\n \nAt the moment, UMI is actively entering the DeFi market.

9654,CryptoBlades,cryptoblades,SKILL,active,token,"## What Is CryptoBlades (SKILL)?\n\nCryptoBlades is an[NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) crafting game that runs on [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) (BSC). It is web-based and users need to play the game on the official CryptoBlades website. Players employ powerful weapons to defeat opponents and collect SKILL tokens, which can be used for upgrades and to level up characters.\n\nThe game's roadmap also includes an NFT marketplace, where players can advertise their manufactured products for sale and increase their profits even more significantly. This is also powered by SKILL and adds more functionality to the token's capabilities.\n\nThe vision of the game developers is for gamers to regain control of their digital assets, play to earn and increase the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. At the same time, CryptoBlades aims to provide a fun and profitable experience for players, to create a healthy and excited community around blockchain gaming. \n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of CryptoBlades?\n\nRiveted Games is the development studio behind CryptoBlades, which has received numerous awards and published on Steam. BSC News, rug detective and oxbull.tech have all verified their identities. They have seven years of industry experience. \n\nThe development team includes Philip Devine, the brain behind the game and the owner of Riveted Technology. Other team members include Kyle Kemp, the front-end developer of the group; Raymond Hammarling who handles the back-end development; and Daniel Karsai, the blockchain developer.\n\n\n#### What Makes CryptoBlades Unique?\n\nNFTs such as Cryptoblades allow gamers to play games and earn at the same time. Players can fight opponents with powerful weapons in CryptoBlades to gain SKILL tokens. The native token SKILL is used to create characters, construct weapons of various potencies and level up your character as you progress through the game. The more powerful your weapon, the greater the amount of SKILL you gain.\n\nEven though Cryptoblades is not the first or the only NFT game available today, it has some unique features. Let's take a look at some of them.\n\nStable and Fair Payment Structure\n\nOracle is in charge of determining the game's rewards and pricing mechanics. The sole aim of Oracle is to balance the SKILL payment with its current value when players win fights or make upgrades. The company also balances the game economy, which ensures regular distributions of the equivalent dollar value of the token during every transaction. Thus, CryptoBlades has a well-balanced and theoretically fair payment structure.\n\nLow Capital for Entry\n\nCryptoBlades is a game that does not require huge capital to play, which allows P2E gamers to divert their profits to a more sustainable investment. The amount of SKILLS earned per day is about 0.75 SKILLS, which translates to approximately $33 per day ($990/month), assuming that the amount of reward per match does not change significantly from day to day.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[What is Axie Infinity](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">?</span>\n\n[What are Cryptopunks](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cryptopunks)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">?</span>\n\n[What is Web 3.0?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0)\n\nFor updates on other projects, visit[ our blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog)\n\n\n#### How Many CryptoBlades (SKILL) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nSKILL is the governance token for CryptoBlades: it reached an all-time high of $858.99 as of August 2021. SKILL serves as the native game currency for CryptoBlades. Players leverage SKILL to acquire characters, forge and reforge weapons, and to buy and sell on the CryptoBlades Marketplace. However, SKILLS acquired in-game are not transferable to the marketplace.\n\nCryptoBlades has a circulating supply of 777,945.51 SKILL coins, which is about 78% of the maximum supply of 1,000,000 SKILL coins.\n\nThe supply of SKILL is designated as follows:\n\n·        IDO – 35%\n\n·        Gameplay Incentives – 20%\n\n·        Development – 20%\n\n·        Initial Liquidity – 15%\n\n·        Liquidity Incentives – 10%\n\nThe development fund vests at a rate of 25% per quarter and for the Investor fund at a rate of 25% per month.\n\n\n### How Is the CryptoBlades Network Secured?\n\nThe CryptoBlades platform is secured with SSL encryption, which guarantees safety of personal data and information shared on the platform.\n\n\n## When Will CryptoBlades Trading Begin?\n\nTrading of CryptoBlades is currently in progress.\n\n\n## Can CryptoBlades Coin Hit $1?\n\nAs of now, CryptoBlades is already over $1, trading at $43.85.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy CryptoBlades (SKILL)?\n\nWhen it comes to buying CryptoBlades, the most popular exchanges are now Gate.io, XT.COM, LBank, BKEX and WBF Exchange. Other cryptocurrency exchanges are also available.

9867,Hot Cross,hot-cross,HOTCROSS,active,token,"$HOTCROSS Token\r\n\r\nThe native digital cryptographically-secured ecosystem utility token of Hot Cross ($HOTCROSS) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of Hot Cross, which is designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on Hot Cross and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token on the protocol/network which allows users to access a various number of products in the Hot Cross suite. \r\n\r\nThis includes access into Cross Pool, discounts or rebates on cross-chain B2B tool creation and associated B2C analytics, and DAO-style power over the decision making and governance of select portions of the Hot Cross ecosystem. We have found that overpromising token utilities can be dangerous, so from a top level our primary objectives are as follows:\r\n\r\n- $HOTCROSS acts as the native currency of the suite of cross-chain tools that are developed for the Ethereum and other EVM-compatible ecosystems, including, but not limited to, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain, and OKExChain. This means that $HOTCROSS will may be spent for access into Hot Cross products, including, but not limited to, Cross Mint, Cross Pool, Cross Bridge, early alpha/beta access into components like Cross Connect, and preferred access into the set of API's that we are developing under Cross API;\r\n- If in the future $HOTCROSS itself moves canonical from ERC20 to BEP20, Substrate, Solana, NEAR, et al. then the same ethos around utilities apply. Nothing fundamentally about the token itself is dependent on one chain surviving;\r\n- The intention of Hot Cross is to start out centralized and then move into a DAO such that $HOTCROSS holders have say in how the protocols, tools, and blockchains related to Hot Cross operate. We are very aware that DeFi and governance have many problems that are incredibly hard to overcome and do not pretend to believe that simply holding a protocol's tokens has any merit in and of itself without meaningful contributions made. Some of the tools that Hot Cross builds are strictly B2B and some are B2C (or DTC); we will take a wait-and-see approach towards a DAO;\r\n- $HOTCROSS will be a staked asset to protect the blockchain - tentatively called Hot Cross Chain - that's created to ensure that ecosystem actors are being responsible. This is similar to the rationale behind the use of PoS, PoSA, hybrid consensus, and PoH. Hot Cross Chain itself does not own or run any computing/storage servers, yet third-party computational resources are required for protecting a chain state, so providers of these resources (i.e. validators) would require payment for the consumption of these resources to maintain network integrity, and $HOTCROSS will be used as the network currency to quantify and pay the costs of the consumed computational resources.\r\n- And during the lifespan of $HOTCROSS we will pay close attention to ecosystem actors and reward them for participation and contributions for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. This can mean creating on-chain liquidity, minting NFTs via Cross Mint, staking LPs or single-sided tokens in Cross Pool, or staking $HOTCROSS to access our suite of premium API endpoints (Cross API). This also means retroactive rewards that we do not communicate ahead of time; we have found that rewarding participation in an ecosystem in a retroactive manner creates more psychological stickiness to a product suite.\r\n\r\nIf we discover that other blockchains are more suitable for our needs, then we will quickly pivot that way. In particular this means Substrate, Solana, NEAR, or any other chain that develops out an ecosystem that we are able to tap into with relevance. We remain agnostic about the technologies that we use and $HOTCROSS itself is meant to be cross-chain from the first day of its launch. Hot Cross as a team is focused on tooling and eschews dogma; if we find niches to fill then we will aggressively go after them regardless of where they are located.",hotcross,,"yield-farming, binance-smart-chain","Yield farming, Binance Smart Chain",https://hotcross.com/,https://twitter.com/hotcrosscom,,https://discord.gg/Ymv3wbNWdZ,https://bscscan.com/token/0x4fa7163e153419e0e1064e418dd7a99314ed27b6,https://reddit.com/r/hotcross,,https://github.com/hotcrosscom,,1839,2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,True

10153,SafeMeme,safememe,SME,active,token,"## What Is SafeMeme (SME)?\n\nSafeMeme ($SME) is a deflationary token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), meaning there are virtually no gas fees and almost instantaneous swaps! This is a token that rewards holders and punishes sellers, which can encourage a steadier price action.\nSafeMeme is the first Rugpull-Proof utility token and all-in-one BSC platform. All projects will have to meet our security protocol and in-depth guidelines to assure new investors that their investments are safe! Having these new tokens follow our safety protocol significantly lowers the risk of investing in new projects.\nThe SafeMeme token is designed to reward its holders. Each transaction generates a 6% fee that translates to passive income!\n2% is redistributed between all holders.\n2% is burned, causing an increase in value.\n2% is sent to the liquidity pool, increasing the stability of SME.\n\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe have a dynamic, non-anon team on all our socials. The creator has been subject to a rug pull himself, so we know how horrible it is! We genuinely want to try and make this project succeed along with the community. That's why we promise to be active on all current socials, to answer any questions you may have, and to enforce a strong community spirit! A team wallet will be used for any costs associated with the project, for example, marketing, dev costs, exchange listing costs, etc. Everyone can see the transactions of this wallet as it is in the public domain. Furthermore, we will let everyone know of any significant transactions that will be withdrawn from this wallet.\n\n\n## The Vision\n\nSafeMeme's vision is to provide a solution to the significant issue that the market is facing. There are way too many ""rug pull"" scams where new BEP20 tokens are being created to scam new investors or FOMO investors into scam projects. We're building a platform where new projects will have to be audited before they will be listed; by doing that, new investors can come onto our platform to see which new projects have passed our safety protocol. That includes contract auditing, presale & launch auditing (avoiding whales, bots, whitelisting, etc.), tokenomics auditing, creating a protocol that solely approves non-risky projects. We're at the stage right now where we have a strong community backing us up; we already have the rules of what new projects have to meet to pass our audit. Now we started working on developing a BEP20 token exchange platform that is based on V2 liquidity. After that, we will begin taking applications from new BEP20 tokens; the auditing process will cost these projects a certain amount of money distributed between all wallet holders & the dev team for salaries, expenses, etc. Our end game: is to create a safe platform for new investors to have an additional layer of safety while investing in BEP20 tokens. While being a utility token, we are also a community-driven token that holders receive a portion of the auditing fee and selling fee (6% total fee, 2% burn, 2% redistribution between holders, 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet. ). To summarize: we believe that the market is firmly in need of a project like SafeMeme, and we are here to stop the BEP20 token scams and restore faith in crypto investing.\n\n\n## Where Can I Buy SafeMeme (SME)?\n\nSafeMeme is currently available on PancakeSwap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x36dBcBCA106353D49e1E0E8974492fFB862a0C92.\n\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nWe have built a token that will reward you for holding it without having to stake it manually. Just sit back, relax, and watch your $SafeMeme automatically increase!\nEach transaction triggers a 6% fee, where 2% is redistributed to all the current holders in proportion to their existing holdings, 2% is burned, decreasing the token's total supply (making it more scarce over time), and 2% is added to the locked liquidity wallet.\nThis inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. Once SafeMeme is burned down to 100 Million tokens, the burning will stop to ensure the platform's longevity.\n5% Dev & Crew: 50,000,000,000 - Crew & Dev Token\n15% Treasury: 150,000,000,000 - Treasury Reserve - Platform Development, Marketing, Audits, Future Listings, Social Media Promos, Legal Fees, Business Fees.\n20% Liquidity Lock: 200,000,000,000 - Initial Liquidity - Locked For One Year\n35% Presale: 350,000,000,000\n25% Burn: 250,000,000,000 - 30 billion $SME burn on launch, and 20 billion $SME burn each month for 11 months.\nThe monthly burn will help stabilize the coin for the first year and reward those who hold long-term. This will provide enough time and stabilization to get the exchange up and running and widespread enough that the token can stabilize itself and increase in price per the exchange.\n\n## Links-\n\nWebsite- https://SafeMeme.com\nTelegram- https://t.me/safememetoken\nDiscord- https://discord.gg/QucrEUeVSC\nWhite Paper- https://safememe.com/white-paper\nCoinMarketCap- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safememe/\nAll Links- https://safememe.com/links",SafeMeme,,"memes, binance-smart-chain","Memes, Binance Smart Chain",https://www.safememe.com,https://twitter.com/safememetoken,,"https://t.me/SafeMemeToken, https://discord.gg/QucrEUeVSC",https://bscscan.com/token/0x36dBcBCA106353D49e1E0E8974492fFB862a0C92,https://reddit.com/r/SafeMeme,https://www.safememe.com/white-paper,https://github.com/SafeMemeOfficial/SafeMeme,,1839,2021-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,True

Like some other meme cryptocurrencies, Baby Doge awards users by giving them a percentage of every transaction that occurs. That means users’ wallets will receive BabyDoge automatically over time. This reflection encourages more supporters and holders of the coin. BabyDoge bills itself as a “hyper-deflationary” crypto, meaning it will become increasingly more valuable and scarce over time. \n\nBabyDoge was launched in June 2021 and has an ambitious roadmap that includes further efforts for pet charity, NFT marketplace creation, and listing on major centralized crypto exchanges.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of BabyDoge?\n\nAs with other meme cryptocurrencies, it is unclear who the creators and main team behind BabyDoge are. These developers built BabyDoge using the Binance Smart Chain to create an ecosystem that is still Ethereum-compatible. Since its inception in June 2021, BabyDoge has amassed a community of 250k token holders, 85k Telegram members, 85k Twitter followers, and 45,000 Instagram followers. \n\n\n#### What Makes BabyDoge Unique?\n\nBabyDoge is focused on increasing the value of the crypto for its users while donating some proceeds to save dogs along the way.

Baby Doge employs three functions to improve Baby Doge’s scarcity and value: Reflection (adding coins to holders’ wallets), LP acquisition (added as a liquidity pair on PancakeSwap), and coin burning. Of the 10% transaction fee, 5% is redistributed to Baby Doge Coin holders, and 5% is sold by the contract into BNB and added automatically as a liquidity pair on Pancake Swap.\n\nBaby Doge Coin also maintains a charity wallet with 2.2% of the total supply to donate to dog rescues and shelters. \n\n\n### How Is the Baby Doge Coin Network Secured?\n\nBaby Doge uses the [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) to provide a Proof of Staked Authority consensus that relies on 21 validators to provide decentralization and enable community involvement.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge)?\n\nIf you would like to buy Baby Doge, the top exchanges for trading in Baby Doge Coin are currently [XT.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/xt/), [LBank](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/), [PancakeSwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/), [CoinW](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinw/), and [DODO BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/dodo-bsc/).\n\n[Find more information here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) about buying cryptocurrency. \n",,"Due to the preponderance of Baby Doge clones, kindly note that this is the first version of the asset bearing the 'Baby Doge' moniker that has been covered in the mainstream press.","memes, binance-smart-chain","Memes, Binance Smart Chain",https://www.babydogecoin.com,https://twitter.com/babydogecoin,,"https://t.me/babydogecoin, https://discord.gg/babydogecoin",https://bscscan.com/token/0xc748673057861a797275cd8a068abb95a902e8de,,,,,1839,2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,True

The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells). Redistribution is based on percentage (in the contract), current token balance and number of holders.  You receive more tokens automatically.\r\n\r\nBNB redistribution\r\nPopularized by HODL and GhostFace, a transaction fee is applied to every single buy /sell order, tokens are then swapped in real-time for BNB and added to a POOL (similar to how liquidity pools work). Holders can then go to a website and manually claim the BNB earned at specific time (daily / weekly / etc..). The BNB they can collect are based on their token holdings % and the current pool size.\r\n\r\nThe token contract employs a static rewards system of 15% of every transaction split in two:\r\n\r\n- 10% BNB is redistributed to holders\r\n- 5% is used to fuel the liquidity pool exchange growth\r\n- The contract keeps track in an array of all token holders\r\n- The contract keeps an index into the array for processing\r\n- Every transaction processes a certain number of users, depending on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens)\r\n- The token is based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all BNB the contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the token holders.\r\n- When a user is processed, the contract checks how many withdrawable dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum threshold for auto-claims, will either automatically claim those dividends for BNB, or automatically buy back tokens for them.\r\n\r\nThis system is fully automated and doesn't add minimal gas fees proportional to value transferred. The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size. Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It's a fair system, fully automated.\r\n\r\nAnti-Dump Logic \r\nPrice protection features such as max tx on sells are included. Any transaction selling more than 0.1% of total supply will be rejected. This prevents massive one time sells that drastically alter the token price.\r\n\r\nExtra 3% Sell fee \r\nSwing trading is a common practice that can affect price action.

10688,Yield Guild Games,yield-guild-games,YGG,active,token,"## What Is Yield Guild Games (YGG)?\n\nYield Guild Games (YGGs) is a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) that invests in virtual world non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)). The organization’s objective is to develop the world’s largest virtual economy, optimize its assets to maximize utility and share revenues with its stakeholders.\n\nIn decentralized games, Yield Guild Games has built a community of players and investors who make money by investing in NFTs, used in virtual worlds and blockchain-based games. People became more eager to participate in play-to-earn games due to the pandemic, which helped the platform grow in popularity.\n\n\n### Who Are the Founders of Yield Guild Games?\n\nThe company behind the Yield Guild Game is a Manila-based game studio founded by Gabby Dizon, a part of the team that launched the Axie Infinity and Yearn Finance Communities. Beryl Li and Owl of Moitness co-founded the Game studio. Beryl Li is an entrepreneur, an alumnus of Cambridge University who has also served as a president of the Cryptocurrency Society in 2016. She is also a co-founder at CapchainX and is a licensed financial consultant. Owl of Moistness is a blockchain developer; he has built algorithms for many bots and NFTs, including Axie Infinity.\n\nToday, the Yield Guild Game team has grown to over 20 members, with Nolan Manalo (also known as Nate) as the head of the gaming operations.\n\n\n#### What Makes  Yield Guild Games Unique?\n\nThe DAO’s principal revenue comes from leveraging YGG-owned NFT assets directly or indirectly via a rental scheme in which members of the guild use the assets in exchange for a portion of the in-game rewards going directly to YGG. For in-game assets such as land, third parties (non-guild members) can generate revenue by conducting economic activities on that in-game land.\n\nNFT ownership will gain from an increase in the economic worth of the in-game asset reflected in the value of its NFT on the open market.\n\nThe game also contains a play-to-earn feature, where users receive native tokens for in-game activity.\n\n\n#### Related Pages:\n\n[What is Zed Run](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zed-run)\n\n[What is Art Blocks](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/art-blocks)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">?</span>\n\n[What are crypto debit cards?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-crypto-debit-cards)\n\nFor crypto information and updates, visit[ our blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n#### How Many  Yield Guild Games (YGG) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Yield Guild Games has had a 9.61% increase in value. With a current market capitalization of $151,079,527, the current CoinMarketCap ranking is #257. YGG coins are now in circulation in 74,275,864 units, with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 units.\n\nTo support the YGG community, the gaming startup has set aside 45% of a total token supply of one billion tokens. The tokens will be distributed gradually over four years, according to the business. In addition, about 40% of the tokens will be distributed to investors (24.9%) and founders 15%), with the remaining 15% going to the company’s treasury and advisors.\n\n\n### How Is the  Yield Guild Games Network Secured?\n\nYGG built a subDAO to host a specific game’s assets and activities. Assets in the subDAO are bought, owned and controlled by the YGG treasury through a multisignature (multisig) hardware wallet to ensure maximum security. The players’ community would be able to put assets to work through smart contracts.\n\n\n## When Will  Yield Guild Games Trading Begin?\n\nTrading of the Yield Guild Game began on July 27, 2021. \n\n\n## Can Yield Guild Games Coin Hit $1?\n\nThe live Yield Guild Games price at the time of creating this piece is $2.03.\n\n\n### Where Can You Buy  Yield Guild Games (YGG)?\n\nThere are many exchanges where you can buy the YGG coin; the top exchanges for trading in Yield Guild Games are currently OKEx, Gate.io, ZT, Uniswap (V3), XT.COM,and Uniswap (V3). \n\nIf you find buying this cryptocurrency difficult, we have[ a guide](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) that can help you out.\n",,,"collectibles-nfts, gaming, entertainment, play-to-earn","Collectibles & NFTs, Gaming, Entertainment, Play to Earn",https://yieldguild.io/,https://twitter.com/YieldGuild,,https://discord.com/invite/ygg,https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f8087ead173b73d6e8b84329989a8eea16cf73,,https://yieldguild.io/YGG-Whitepaper-English.pdf,,,1027,2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,True

11035,Splinterlands,splinterlands,SPS,active,token,"## What Is Splinterlands (SPS)?\n\n[Splinterlands](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/splinterlands/) is a digital, collectible card game based on blockchain technology and inspired by games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, where players build a collection of cards with different attributes and battle other players in skills-based matches. It is a game where players can buy, sell and trade their digital assets just as they would with physical trading cards games such as Magic the Gathering, Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!\n\nSplinterlands was created as players lost the ability to truly own their assets (or trading cards) once games went digital. With blockchain technology, it allows players to own and trade their digital assets freely once again. It also allows the game to have true scarcity and transparency, which means all cards on Splinterlands have a verifiable supply and historical record. \n\nPlayers battle other players by choosing ranked or practice battles. With ranked battles, players can increase their rating. There is no downside to playing ranked battles as a beginner since players with a rating below 100 do not lose ranking points. Battles take place between players of similar strength. When matched up with an opponent, both players choose a set of six monster cards and one summoner card for the battle to destroy all their opponent’s monster cards and win the battle.\n\nAlthough the game is free-to-play, players need to purchase the summoner’s spellbook for $10 if they want to unlock the game in full. With the summoner’s spellbook, players get access to their account keys and unlock the ability to earn Dark Energy Crystals, which can be redeemed for real currency. \n\nSplinterlands started in May 2018 and launched Splintershards (SPS) – its [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) for the SPS [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) (DAO) at the end of July 2021. It concluded a $3.6M private token sale for 6.6% of the SPS token supply. After reaching 100,000 players in its first three years, it added another 50,000 in just over a month from June 2021. Splinterland plans to build out its game in the latter half of 2021, with oracle integration planned for Q1 2022.\n\n\n## Who Are the Founders of Splinterland?\n\nJesse Reich and Matthew Rosen, who go under “aggroed” and “yabapmatt” on the Splinterlands Discord server are the two founders. Both are from the Pennsylvania area. While Reich is a former scientist and chemistry professor without any professional gaming experience prior to Splinterlands, Rosen worked as a developer for RockYou and Ryzing, both gaming projects, albeit not blockchain-based.\n\nIn total, the Splinterlands team consists of 12 employees as per their LinkedIn page.\n\n\n## What Makes Splinterland Unique?\n\nSplinterland aims to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based games that offer the possibility to own unique digital assets. At the end of July 2021, it closed a private round for $3.6 million in exchange for only 6.6% of the entire token supply. \n\nSplinterlands runs on the [Hive blockchain](https://docs.splinterlands.com/hiveblockchain), meaning all actions in the game are recorded on the blockchain. That means anyone can join the game by creating a Hive blockchain address, making the game permissionless. It also provides Splinterlands with a transparent record of all actions in the game, including battle results, which ensures fairness and transparency. \n\nPlayers have a base set of cards and can purchase booster packs or specific cards from other players. These cards can be leveled up and used in battle against other players. In these ranked battles, players compete for Dark Energy Crystals (DEC), the in-game currency of Splinterlands. Players can also obtain DEC by converting unused cards in their collection. DEC can be used to buy in-game items or trading cards from other players on the Splinterland market. DEC are also tradable among players and on third-party exchanges. The utility of DEC will continue to increase as more features are added to the game.\n\nThe Splintershards (SPS) token will work as a DAO on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) platform. The SPS token is a governance token that will be integrated into the Splinterland game, giving players the option to influence decisions about the game and the ecosystem. Players may also propose their own changes, such as changing the tournament schedule, modifying the battle settings, or a change to the DEC inflation pools.\n\n\n#### **Related Pages:**\n\nCheck out [Axie Infinity (AXS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/) — a pet-oriented trading game incorporating NFTs.\n\nCheck out [AnRKey X (ANRX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/anrkey-x/) — another highly popular NFT game.\n\nLearn how NFTs work in our [guide to Non-Fungible Tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft).\n\nGet the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).\n\n\n## How Many Splinterlands (SPS) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe maximum total supply will be 3 billion SPS tokens. As per their [token distribution schedule](https://sps.splinterlands.com/distribution), Splinterlands plans to airdrop 400 million, or 13.33% of their tokens, over a year to players holding Splinterlands assets. This is to encourage players to accumulate and hold Splinterlands assets for longer. Players can earn airdrop points for different assets, which will be used to determine how many SPS they receive.\n\n200 million SPS, or 6.66%, were allocated in the private sale in July 2021 for $3.6 million. Investors include crypto-native funds such as Animoca Brands, Blockchain Founders Fund, Enjin, Polygon, Yield Guild Games, and more. They will be unlocked over 10 months. \n\nThe remaining token supply is allocated as follows: 10% will be controlled by the DAO, which is planned for Q1 2022; 9% will be held by the team and unlocked over 65 months, with 50 million unlocked on day one; 1% reserved for advisors, to be unlocked over 24 months; 60% reserved for staking and oracle rewards, as well as for play to earn rewards for players, to be released over a 65-month schedule.\n\n\n## How Is the Splinterlands Network Secured?\n\nSplinterlands’ SPS token will be set up on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) (BSC) blockchain. The team decided against Ethereum because gas fees on Ethereum became prohibitively high, limiting the number of people who can participate. BSC has fast transaction times and low transaction fees, as well as the function to port smart contracts to Ethereum, making a future move possible.\n\nBSC is secured through the [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). 21 validators are elected every 24 hours to validate transactions and maintain blockchain security. These validators have to stake a certain amount of BNB coins with Binance to be eligible to do so. Holders of SPS tokens will be able to stake their SPS in smart contracts to participate in governance voting.\n\nWhile the SPS token lives on BSC, the game itself is on the Hive blockchain. Interactions between the two will be handled by oracles, who will be users or entities elected by SPS holders that are tasked with relaying relevant information from the game to the Binance Smart Chain. This is the technically optimal solution to minimize transaction fees while optimizing the gaming experience. In-game-related actions stay on Hive, but conversions to SPS tokens will be relayed by oracles.\n\n\n## When Will Splinterlands (SPS) Trading Begin?\n\nAfter its private round in July 2021, Splinterlands plans to begin its airdrop and liquidity incentives in Q3 2021.\n\n\n## Can Splinterlands Hit $1?\n\n[Splinterlands](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/splinterlands/) is trading around $0.40 as of August 2021, so reaching $1 would be a little more than double the price. Given that Splinterlands managed to raise $3.6M in its recent private sale, it shows strong interest and backing from investors. With its new features and number of users growing considerably, it will be one to watch. Furthermore, considering that other popular NFT games accomplished 10X of their initial trading value and more, $1 might not be far.\n\n\n## Where Can You Buy Splinterlands (SPS)?\n\nAs of August 2021, you can buy SPS on [Pancakeswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/en/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/en/exchanges/gate-io/), [BKEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/en/exchanges/bkex/) and [Bilaxy](https://coinmarketcap.com/en/exchanges/bilaxy/). \n\nIf you want to learn more about how you can start buying cryptocurrencies, you can read more in our guide [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).",Splinterlands,,"collectibles-nfts, gaming, binance-smart-chain, play-to-earn","Collectibles & NFTs, Gaming, Binance Smart Chain, Play to Earn",https://splinterlands.com,https://twitter.com/splinterlands,"https://peakd.com/@splinterlands, https://www.publish0x.com/splinterlands\r\nhttps://www.splintertalk.io/","https://discord.splinterlands.com, https://t.me/splinterlandsHQ",https://bscscan.com/address/0x1633b7157e7638c4d6593436111bf125ee74703f,https://reddit.com/r/Splinterlands,https://sps.splinterlands.com,https://github.com/steem-monsters,https://peakd.com/splinterlands/@splinterlands/splintershards-token-and-airdrop-launch-announcement,1839,2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,2018-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,True
